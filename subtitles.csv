19.44,4.08,ongoing way so affiliate marketing is my
21.72,3.6,favorite form of monetization it's how
23.52,2.82,my blog adaminfo.com makes over a
25.32,2.76,hundred thousand dollars a month with
26.34,3.3,that Revenue stream and I'm pumped to
28.08,3.84,share this real business information

31.92,4.02,full course is how to create a real
33.42,3.96,affiliate marketing business in 2023.
35.94,3,now it's still the best way in my
37.38,3.54,opinion to make passive income because
38.94,4.08,we're promoting other people's products
40.92,3.659,we don't need a huge audience yet and we
43.02,2.76,don't need our own product and it's a
44.579,2.461,great way to make passive income you
45.78,2.7,don't have to do a whole lot it doesn't
47.04,3.06,require a lot of money to get started
48.48,3.239,and building affiliate marketing Market
50.1,3.6,marketing website is pretty easy these
51.719,3.66,days however turning this into a real
53.7,2.58,business can be more challenging so
55.379,2.641,that's what we're going to break down
56.28,3.299,for you so first of all why affiliate
58.02,3.3,marketing where does it fit well there's
59.579,3.78,a lot of reasons to own your own website
61.32,3.78,this is the central repository of your
63.359,3.001,personal brand every personal brand
65.1,2.879,every person out there should have their
66.36,4.2,own website and even if you're a
67.979,4.261,YouTuber or on Instagram a website is
70.56,3.54,what is the central repository of the
72.24,3.48,information about you so why don't we
74.1,2.879,start a website and make a lot of
75.72,2.82,affiliate income doing the same thing
76.979,2.941,it's the starting point it's the perfect
78.54,3.24,Revenue stream if you don't have an
79.92,4.199,audience yet it dictates your initial
81.78,3.839,content strategy so the right keywords
84.119,3.481,equals money so when we think about how
85.619,3.661,do we make the most money from affiliate
87.6,3.059,marketing well we need a website because
89.28,3.42,of search intent and people buying
90.659,3.841,things online via Google search and we
92.7,3.419,need to rank for the right keywords so
94.5,3.36,ranking for the right keywords requires
96.119,3.54,that you create content around affiliate
97.86,3.66,marketing keywords and you need to know
99.659,3.841,that stuff which dictates the initial
101.52,3.959,content that you create also you can
103.5,3.659,fail a lot I failed tons of times and
105.479,3.121,the great thing about a website and
107.159,2.82,affiliate marketing is you can fail and
108.6,3.299,you don't affect customers you know it's
109.979,3.361,not an e-commerce business where you can
111.899,3,ship products and it messes up and
113.34,3.66,people get pissed at you you just create
114.899,3.841,content when a Blog is an infinitely
117,3,updatable asset that can be updated an
118.74,2.879,infinite number of times you can fail
120,4.14,lot and you learn a lot you learn about
121.619,3.6,seo on-page seo keyword research link
124.14,2.64,building affiliate marketing
125.219,3.361,monetization how the internet works you
126.78,2.88,learn it all as you do it and there's
128.58,2.159,really a lot of scams out there when
129.66,2.34,you're learning this stuff so I want you
130.739,2.881,to take it from someone like me who's
132,3.48,built a real affiliate business who has
133.62,3.42,a Blog adamandfro.com who's ranked for
135.48,2.82,over four years for Content who's made
137.04,3.48,over a hundred thousand dollars a month
138.3,4.74,with affiliate marketing for over 12
140.52,3.84,months in a row not somebody saying with
143.04,2.4,a nice thumbnail on YouTube saying
144.36,2.519,here's how you make five thousand
145.44,3.12,dollars a month but they don't really
146.879,3.121,have good information here which is why
148.56,3.66,we're going to take it as you know to
150,3.72,the next level and give real strategic
152.22,3.239,business advice here
153.72,2.82,and ultimately affiliate marketing is
155.459,2.881,the first Revenue stream of many
156.54,3.36,affiliate marketing starts then you can
158.34,2.94,do ad Revenue then you can eventually
159.9,2.94,sell your own product you can do
161.28,3.539,Consulting you can do all kinds of
162.84,3.24,different revenue streams but we need to
164.819,3.121,start somewhere and affiliate marketing
166.08,3.06,is where we start so let's talk about
167.94,2.82,building your affiliate marketing
169.14,2.819,website first so if you don't have a
170.76,2.339,website yet this is where you need to
171.959,2.761,get started
173.099,3.78,let's talk about choosing your domain
174.72,4.08,name this is why I like personal brand
176.879,3.541,websites so
178.8,3.18,the no way name doesn't matter for
180.42,3.599,ranking content on Google it doesn't
181.98,3.6,matter if you have a keyword Rich domain
184.019,3.061,name or anything like that what matters
185.58,3.299,is you have something you can fail a lot
187.08,3.6,at and you won't quit that's ultimately
188.879,3.541,what matters and I started mine at
190.68,3.419,adamandfro.com my own name I was going
192.42,3.179,to use it as like a digital resume maybe
194.099,3.121,use it for my career write a few
195.599,3.36,affiliate articles I didn't think I'd
197.22,3.54,make that much money but it ended up
198.959,3.301,working because of new startup tactics I
200.76,3.119,was using and just the fact that I
202.26,3.18,didn't quit and that was at my name now
203.879,2.821,what you can do is if you don't want to
205.44,3.18,put it at your full name I would just
206.7,3.3,say firstlastname.com you can do that
208.62,3.18,and rank for anything you choose to
210,3.959,write about change niches if it doesn't
211.8,3.24,work try and test new things out you
213.959,3.14,could also like I could have went back
215.04,4.38,and used something like adamsguide.com
217.099,4.301,adamsadvice.com something broad enough
219.42,3.539,where I want to be known for one thing
221.4,3.419,so I want to be in one Niche I want to
222.959,3.601,cover it but it can be me it's my name
224.819,3.541,that's why I was able to now be on
226.56,3.539,YouTube because it's just tied to my
228.36,3.299,name I didn't create a niche site called
230.099,3.06,the email marketing guy I would have
231.659,3.061,pigeonholed myself into that one
233.159,3.601,category and then I would have been
234.72,3.599,screwed for YouTube Instagram Tick Tock
236.76,3.479,and all of those things but I think a
238.319,3.301,personal brand is the perfect way to
240.239,3,start so first you're going to need to
241.62,3.36,host your website and this is basically
243.239,3.901,where your website stores all its files
244.98,3.899,folders images and this is the main
247.14,3.659,ongoing cost of running a websites so I
248.879,3.541,really like wpx for WordPress they have
250.799,3.481,really fast hosting and I also really
252.42,4.319,like Nexus so they offer affordable
254.28,3.72,plans starting at just 19 a month you
256.739,4.441,get a lot of perks with that so you get
258,6.24,features like SSL for security so https
261.18,4.68,no overage fees 24 7 support so they've
264.24,3.42,also created hosting for maximum speed
265.86,3.54,so they have a built-in CDN content
267.66,3.539,delivery Network image compression
269.4,3.48,caching to make sure everything loads
271.199,3.541,fast because site speed is a major
272.88,3.96,racking ranking Factor when it comes to
274.74,3.66,SEO I like to think of Nexus as the kind
276.84,3.359,of Hosting that people upgrade from
278.4,3.72,shared hosting to Nexus so maybe they
280.199,3.481,start at like Bluehost or HostGator they
282.12,3.18,eventually move to something like Nexus
283.68,3.239,so if you're looking for a you know
285.3,2.58,affordable WordPress hosting make sure
286.919,2.881,to click the link in the description
287.88,3.42,below and sign up for Nexus web hosting
289.8,2.7,so every web host is a little bit
291.3,3.119,different but they're super easy to set
292.5,3.12,up like you would go to either wpx or
294.419,2.821,something like Nexus you'd see their
295.62,3.42,plans and you choose their plans and you
297.24,3.36,can pay annually or monthly you could
299.04,3.42,choose something like the spark plan
300.6,3.36,this is for WordPress and then you just
302.46,3.48,go to checkout so you select the plan
303.96,3.12,you enter your information first last
305.94,3.06,name password your billing address
307.08,3.54,payment info you complete your purchase
309,2.82,and then it gets you into the dashboard
310.62,2.639,and these dashboards look a little bit
311.82,4.08,different but all that you have to do
313.259,4.021,really is use WordPress with them and
315.9,3.48,WordPress is the best content management
317.28,3.54,system and you install WordPress through
319.38,3.36,your host and it's usually a one-click
320.82,3.54,install so you go from your host you say
322.74,3.239,enter WordPress and then you enter
324.36,2.76,WordPress so let's run through we go
325.979,2.821,through that and then we get to what
327.12,4.68,looks like a WordPress dashboard like
328.8,4.679,this WordPress is really simple to use
331.8,3.72,um you can you know it has endless
333.479,3.241,customizations plugins themes all of
335.52,2.88,that everything's on the left hand
336.72,3.12,sidebar there's different plugins
338.4,2.82,there's different pages and posts so
339.84,3.06,we'll go through kind of using Wordpress
341.22,2.94,really quickly in a fast way for your
342.9,2.94,affiliate site first let's talk about
344.16,3.3,your theme which is under appearance
345.84,3.66,themes the theme is like you think of
347.46,3.959,Wix or Weebly it's like the design
349.5,3.18,layout of your site so we can choose a
351.419,3.481,number of different themes that are in
352.68,3.66,this WordPress repository or we find one
354.9,3.78,on our own and I recommend Cadence
356.34,4.74,Cadence WP is a great theme because they
358.68,4.26,have really perfect layouts for all
361.08,3.36,kinds of blogs content affiliate sites
362.94,2.759,they also have Cadence blocks which
364.44,2.52,allows you to create those affiliate
365.699,2.821,blocks like the things that say like
366.96,3.6,check price on Amazon check price at
368.52,3.54,Best Buy all those content blocks Pros
370.56,2.34,cons all of that kind of features you
372.06,2.28,can see they have a number of different
372.9,2.88,starter templates that you can use so
374.34,3.24,you can just check check all of these
375.78,3.06,and see which one that you like and then
377.58,2.76,we can see that when we have it we can
378.84,2.94,customize the theme inside of Wordpress
380.34,2.88,by clicking customize and it gives you
381.78,2.88,some some different settings so this is
383.22,2.759,like a little sample site we created the
384.66,2.819,cafe man
385.979,3.06,and there's colors and fonts you can
387.479,3,change so typography all that kind of
389.039,3.961,stuff all the way down to header footer
390.479,4.261,General post page layouts some you know
393,4.08,theme customization options where the
394.74,4.56,menu is home page settings how does it
397.08,3.78,display it site identity so you know add
399.3,3.66,your logo add your text and all of that
400.86,3.42,and then it's just pretty easy to to
402.96,3.6,edit these things and they all lay out
404.28,3.479,in a simple format and you know with
406.56,3.18,cadence if you're interested in learning
407.759,3.241,like the exacts Click by click process I
409.74,3.06,don't want to cover in this full this
411,3.36,video exactly it'll take like a 45
412.8,2.88,minutes to show you every little detail
414.36,2.399,of this but you can click the link in
415.68,2.459,the description below sign up for my
416.759,2.701,free Master Class where we cover all of
418.139,3.12,this stuff and more another nice thing
419.46,3.72,with cadence is they have Cadence blocks
421.259,3.78,so in the left hand sidebar you can go
423.18,4.019,to all your posts view your blog posts
425.039,3.961,go into individual ones that we want to
427.199,3.241,create and we know that blog posts have
429,3.12,a very similar format when it comes to
430.44,3.18,affiliate content so we'll cover the
432.12,3,exact formula and show you some examples
433.62,3.359,but we can see that like Cadence blocks
435.12,3.84,is it builds its own table of contents
436.979,3.301,maker with pulling headings in if we'd
438.96,4.019,enter and choose a new line we can
440.28,4.139,select browse what we want to add and we
442.979,2.461,can see Cadence blocks here and we can
444.419,3.06,add all kinds of different things
445.44,3.96,Advanced but countdowns Google Maps
447.479,3.421,icons Advanced images
449.4,3.239,Celia posts are really simple to write
450.9,4.019,you know it's about using Wordpress
452.639,3.78,because it has the best functionality
454.919,2.941,for creating these types of posts what
456.419,4.381,do we need when we need headings to tell
457.86,5.22,Google what this post is H1 H2 content
460.8,3.78,and then what's nice is again we go back
463.08,3.72,to we're assembling content we're not
464.58,3.54,just writing from a blank page there's a
466.8,3,specific way to write these kinds of
468.12,3.359,affiliate articles that rank with
469.8,3.6,headings and then you can see that this
471.479,3.84,is a nice Cadence block with two columns
473.4,3.96,image on the left side text on the right
475.319,4.32,with a button check price on Amazon with
477.36,4.679,a nice border around it top pick but you
479.639,4.081,can create these very simple affiliate
482.039,3.6,content blocks with cadence doesn't
483.72,3.72,require any coding just adding a few
485.639,3.421,little uh templates in so next let's
487.44,3.3,talk about the different plugins that
489.06,2.88,you can use so plugins extend the
490.74,2.76,functionality of Wordpress there's
491.94,3.06,plugins for everything like if you're
493.5,3.539,running a barber shop you get a calendar
495,3.599,Plug-In or you know reservation plug-in
497.039,2.461,for a restaurant but really when it
498.599,2.28,comes to blogging there's just some
499.5,4.319,plugins that we need we need like speed
500.879,5.16,plugins image optimization and affiliate
503.819,4.38,marketing security and a few others but
506.039,3.361,if you look at the um the plugins that
508.199,2.101,we have installed you can see the
509.4,2.819,there's different ones so there's
510.3,3.84,Cadence blocks so we installed that and
512.219,3.361,starter templates rank math is a good
514.14,3.06,one for SEO that you can use and that
515.58,3.899,optimizes your blog post meta
517.2,4.079,description indexes your site and Google
519.479,3.901,if you set it up correctly do all that
521.279,4.261,that's really simple to use short pixel
523.38,4.2,is a good image optimization tool that
525.54,3.9,one allows you to every time you upload
527.58,3.78,an image into your WordPress Library it
529.44,3.66,condenses it down into a smaller JPEG
531.36,3.599,file then there's thirsty Affiliates
533.1,4.38,which is a really good one for
534.959,4.261,uh managing and organizing all of your
537.48,3.18,affiliate links so we'll cover joining
539.22,3.36,affiliate programs but you add them into
540.66,3,this tool as you can see in thirsty
542.58,3.18,Affiliates you can view all your
543.66,3.48,affiliate links you click them here you
545.76,3.72,paste your affiliate link into the
547.14,3.9,destination URL you give it a name you
549.48,2.82,can organize it categorize it and save
551.04,3.18,link and we always want to make sure
552.3,3.9,that links are no follow and open in a
554.22,3,new tab but you know plugins are really
556.2,2.46,useful there's a ton of different
557.22,3.78,plugins that you can have if you want to
558.66,3.66,add new ones there's also word fund
561,3.3,security which is free which is a good
562.32,3.6,one you can go to add new and then you
564.3,3.86,can go through the plugin library and
565.92,4.56,see what there is so a lot of sites come
568.16,4.66,preloaded with jetpack which is a little
570.48,3.539,bit bloated and slows your site down you
572.82,2.28,can use classic editor but you can look
574.019,2.701,through but these are the ones that I
575.1,3.9,recommend or something just to get
576.72,4.26,started use some of these on this list
579,3.779,here there's a few extra plugins I like
580.98,3.6,too there's one called mammoth.docx
582.779,4.021,converter it's another free tool this
584.58,4.199,allows you to upload Google Docs
586.8,3.479,directly into WordPress so if you have
588.779,2.521,it formatted correctly in Google Docs
590.279,2.701,you can add it to Wordpress this is
591.3,4.32,helpful if you have like somebody
592.98,4.02,writing for you or a content writer or
595.62,2.7,you're writing guest posts and it's
597,3.72,really good so you get comfortable with
598.32,3.72,Google Docs and do that WP Rocket's also
600.72,3.299,a good one this is a paid tool but this
602.04,3.419,is the best like speed optimization tool
604.019,2.94,on WordPress there's plenty of good
605.459,3.301,tutorials online of like the exact
606.959,3.961,settings for WP rocket but that's one I
608.76,4.259,use and I recommend for Speed there's
610.92,3.419,easy table of contents which you can use
613.019,2.581,this one if you don't have Cadence or
614.339,3.481,you want to use something different but
615.6,4.2,the table of content solution that kind
617.82,3.3,of works and organizes your content and
619.8,2.64,that's really it so really when we think
621.12,4.56,about the minimum cost to get started
622.44,5.94,let's say we're using wpx 25 a month new
625.68,5.219,domain name might be 13 a year and you
628.38,4.68,pay for WP rocket let's say at 59 a year
630.899,3.301,and then short pixel you pay based on
633.06,2.82,the number of images you need to
634.2,3.24,optimize it's pretty cheap though like
635.88,3.48,ten dollars might get you could get you
637.44,3.42,thousands of images probably but the
639.36,3.3,total cost to get started of a website
640.86,4.86,for affiliate marketing is about 107
642.66,4.679,plus 20 to 25 a month so when we talk
645.72,3.119,about building your minimum viable
647.339,2.94,website that's what I call it a minimum
648.839,3.361,viable site something that's good enough
650.279,3.12,but you haven't perfected it we're not
652.2,2.639,perfectionist here we don't want to
653.399,3.301,spend a month creating a website we can
654.839,3.481,do this in a day or two here's the core
656.7,4.079,four pages you need you need a home page
658.32,4.139,an about page a Blog archive page where
660.779,3,your posts go and then a Blog template
662.459,2.581,so how your blogs are laid out and this
663.779,3.24,is all kind of set up for you but when
665.04,4.5,we think of a home page it's really just
667.019,3.781,here's like a backlinko example kind of
669.54,3.419,looks similar to my home page where it's
670.8,3.96,like you have a main sentence your value
672.959,2.88,proposition at the top and the thing
674.76,2.34,that's good about a homepage when you're
675.839,2.761,first starting your site you can change
677.1,2.94,it an infinite number of times I've
678.6,3.299,changed that sentence on my site
680.04,3.6,probably a hundred times by now because
681.899,3.12,my site's changed and evolved and
683.64,3.18,because it was at my name I could change
685.019,3.721,it and change different things but
686.82,3.24,really a home page is just if you look
688.74,2.82,at it in two seconds I need to
690.06,3,understand what this is about and this
691.56,2.76,is an opportunity to put your face out
693.06,3,there I know it can be uncomfortable for
694.32,3.3,some people you don't have to but you
696.06,4.019,can but a home page should be lead
697.62,4.14,collection so you know building an email
700.079,2.76,list potentially for the future even if
701.76,2.579,you don't have a product yet it's always
702.839,3.18,good to have like at least capturing
704.339,3,people's email and then just a few
706.019,3.361,things about you it doesn't need to be
707.339,3.961,long then an about page should be really
709.38,3.66,a personal story not really about like
711.3,3.18,your accomplishments and everything like
713.04,3,a LinkedIn profile how you're perfect
714.48,3.12,how you're good at this and good at that
716.04,2.88,and you went to this it should be a
717.6,3.78,really good story if you check mine out
718.92,4.5,at adaminfo.com it's more like from my
721.38,3.6,birth all the mistakes I made a little
723.42,3.359,bit about how I started the blog but you
724.98,3.419,should be very vulnerable and share
726.779,2.641,yourself with the world on your about
728.399,2.581,page
729.42,2.96,then you have a Blog archive so that's
730.98,4.5,kind of where your blog lives
732.38,4.6,so.yoursite.com blog and you can dictate
735.48,2.7,that with your theme just choosing how
736.98,3.06,it laid out so you might have a three
738.18,3.839,column layout it might be a one column
740.04,3.18,layout it doesn't really matter honestly
742.019,2.82,these things are kind of going by the
743.22,2.94,wayside people are going to find you by
744.839,3.481,Googling something and visiting your
746.16,3.72,article first so as long as it looks
748.32,3.3,good you don't have to worry about that
749.88,3.66,too much and then a Blog template this
751.62,3.36,will be set up for you in your theme how
753.54,3.78,everything's laid out what your headings
754.98,4.56,look like is there a right hand sidebar
757.32,3.48,or not you know how that works so it's
759.54,2.46,pretty simple so with affiliate
760.8,2.94,marketing you need to think like a
762,3.959,marketer not a writer this is not
763.74,3.36,writing this is monetizing content so
765.959,2.761,you have to be strategic with your
767.1,3.12,approach that's writing keyword research
768.72,2.7,and the layout of your posts so first
770.22,2.94,let's talk about the type of content you
771.42,4.02,have to create there's really just two
773.16,4.2,for affiliate marketing and a Blog in
775.44,3.959,general there's how people use Google
777.36,4.14,and how websites make money there's
779.399,4.201,informational content so how to do stuff
781.5,3.839,pieces of information in your Niche then
783.6,3.84,there's transactional so that's things
785.339,4.381,like best credit cards best camping gear
787.44,4.74,best modular sectionals best living room
789.72,4.5,sofas best patio furniture everything
792.18,4.62,that has best signifies search intent
794.22,3.84,signifies buyer intent and that's where
796.8,2.52,list posts come in when you're
798.06,3.24,recommending and comparing the best
799.32,4.259,products that is 99 of affiliate
801.3,3.839,revenues made through posts like that so
803.579,3.121,we can see that informational post they
805.139,3.121,might have a lot of search volume people
806.7,3.96,search for things about how to do things
808.26,4.68,a lot that can make ad Revenue passive
810.66,4.2,ad Revenue because if you're searching
812.94,3.959,like how to start a business or how to
814.86,3.659,tie your shoes you're not ready to
816.899,3.12,really buy an affiliate product yet but
818.519,3.06,it might be searched a lot so you might
820.019,3.421,as well put banner ads on those types of
821.579,3.181,posts and then affiliate Revenue comes
823.44,2.579,through transactional posts so I'm going
824.76,2.819,to break this down for you so first we
826.019,3.661,have to be strategic with our keywords
827.579,3.601,that's things like search volume and
829.68,3.36,competition so I'm going to give you
831.18,3.48,some examples we'll go through these in
833.04,3.66,what I call the keyword monetization
834.66,4.679,Matrix so there's four different types
836.7,3.72,of keywords that your blog can have and
839.339,3.12,there's two main ones that you need to
840.42,4.2,be focusing on so on the left hand side
842.459,3.901,here we have search volume which is how
844.62,3.18,many times it's searched a month so the
846.36,2.94,more it's searched the more potential
847.8,3.96,traffic you have and then on the bottom
849.3,4.08,we have competition so left to right how
851.76,3.12,competitive is it how many Authority
853.38,3.899,sites are in there how difficult is it
854.88,4.62,to rank for so first let's cover low
857.279,4.921,volume info post so this is low low
859.5,4.98,search volume and low competition these
862.2,3.96,are not that valuable however these are
864.48,2.94,what we call Early wins if you're just
866.16,3.359,starting your affiliate marketing
867.42,3.84,website and you have no traffic yet you
869.519,3.181,have no domain Authority these are some
871.26,3.66,of the ones that can help you get out of
872.7,3.66,that Google sandbox and start ranking
874.92,3.12,for anything you want to start ranking
876.36,3.36,for almost anything in your Niche so
878.04,3.659,that's low volume informational posts
879.72,4.44,what I call Early wins so this example
881.699,4.741,is like the home Niche home living room
884.16,4.44,furniture that kind of stuff so one
886.44,4.199,that's low volume informational this
888.6,3.96,tiny house kitchen ideas pretty Niche
890.639,3.541,pretty long tail not really going to
892.56,3.36,make money because it's an ideas post
894.18,3,people are just looking for inspiration
895.92,3.779,they're not going to purchase something
897.18,3.779,however it could be an early win for
899.699,2.461,your website you could start ranking for
900.959,3.12,something like this a lot quicker
902.16,3.6,because it's not competitive and it's
904.079,3.301,not searched a ton but you can actually
905.76,3.24,rank for it so that's kind of a good
907.38,4.259,starting point for some of your articles
909,4.199,next I want to cover high volume info
911.639,3.901,posts so we see that the search volume
913.199,3.961,is high the competition is generally low
915.54,3.72,and the these are great these are what I
917.16,3.96,call brand builders so you can get a lot
919.26,4.139,of traffic with these low competition
921.12,3.959,high volume there's not about a bunch of
923.399,3.3,search intent to make transactional
925.079,3.541,affiliate Revenue but these are
926.699,4.26,informational keywords so things like
928.62,4.38,dorm room ideas it's searched a lot
930.959,4.201,there's not a ton of competition for it
933,3.54,and it's a pretty high quality post
935.16,3.84,because you can get a lot of traffic for
936.54,4.5,it these ones can make ad Revenue
939,4.019,now we're moving over to the other side
941.04,4.44,this is high surge volume High
943.019,4.44,competition think of antiques this is
945.48,3.419,what I call antique keywords so things
947.459,3.541,that have been around for a long time
948.899,4.68,that are probably impossible to rank for
951,4.56,in the 2020s something like best vacuum
953.579,4.861,cleaner something that's been around for
955.56,5.04,ages best refrigerator best vpns best
958.44,3.24,web hosting good luck you're probably
960.6,3.479,not going to rank for it on your
961.68,4.5,affiliate website in the 2020s maybe if
964.079,3.361,you wrote that post 15 years ago but
966.18,4.14,it's difficult so these are high
967.44,5.16,competition High search volume keywords
970.32,3.78,that are transactional there might be a
972.6,2.88,few in here that you can rank for if you
974.1,2.88,look at the keyword research tools but
975.48,2.94,it'll be difficult
976.98,4.14,and then finally we have lower
978.42,4.38,competition transactional posts so these
981.12,3.899,are like medium competition potentially
982.8,4.02,medium search volume but they're kind of
985.019,3.961,living in this box here these are
986.82,4.56,emerging products so this could be
988.98,4.32,something like best modular sectional
991.38,3.84,not very competitive yet not too
993.3,4.02,competitive not overly competitive a
995.22,4.14,newer product with decent search volume
997.32,3.66,and that is where affiliate marketing
999.36,4.08,lives so these are the two right here
1000.98,4.56,you want high volume info posts ideas
1003.44,4.199,posts things in your Niche that can make
1005.54,4.32,you affiliate ad revenue and get a lot
1007.639,5.521,of traffic to your website and then
1009.86,5.159,affiliate Revenue with these longer tail
1013.16,4.919,emerging products in your Niche these
1015.019,4.38,are the two best plus you know the
1018.079,3.361,keywords in your Niche that can make you
1019.399,3.661,money that are new and then also high
1021.44,3.18,volume brand builders so these are the
1023.06,3.3,two right here so let's break this down
1024.62,4.079,really quick in my favorite SEO tool
1026.36,3.78,hrefs so I'm going to show some examples
1028.699,3.541,here of different keywords and we'll go
1030.14,3.24,through it so again keyword is at the
1032.24,2.699,heart of your affiliate marketing
1033.38,3.36,strategy we don't like choose an
1034.939,3.48,affiliate program and then try to
1036.74,3.66,promote this brand and blast stuff on
1038.419,3.42,Facebook it starts with search intent
1040.4,3.84,which it starts with ranking for
1041.839,4.141,keywords online and that become it comes
1044.24,3.42,down to understanding this stuff at the
1045.98,2.88,snap of a finger knowing this is a good
1047.66,2.519,opportunity this is not a good
1048.86,3.18,opportunity so I'm going to go through
1050.179,3.781,this keyword monetization matrix real
1052.04,3.42,quick and give you examples so
1053.96,3.54,let's look at the bad examples the best
1055.46,3.48,vacuum cleaners the difficulty is hard
1057.5,3.12,it's been around for a long time high
1058.94,3.42,volume traffic potential is all you
1060.62,3.6,could get a hundred thousand visitors a
1062.36,2.819,month just for this keyword but it's
1064.22,3.06,pretty difficult let's look at who's
1065.179,3.841,ranking for this uh we have New York
1067.28,4.139,Times Good Housekeeping the spruce
1069.02,4.5,ratings CNN tech radar times guide
1071.419,3.421,consumerreports and people.com the
1073.52,3.84,chances of a new blog ranking for this
1074.84,4.079,are at probably zero at this point so
1077.36,3.24,that's why it's a bad example if you
1078.919,3.901,look at the top 10 ranking sites here on
1080.6,4.26,ahrefs too competitive I mean these
1082.82,3.42,these websites are massive and
1084.86,3.48,authoritative so it would be difficult
1086.24,4.5,so that why this is tough the volume's
1088.34,4.14,high but it's just kind of too much
1090.74,4.14,different a different example here is
1092.48,4.92,the best modular sectional we can see
1094.88,5.46,this was not searched at all in 2017
1097.4,4.62,2018 2019 is searched now it's you know
1100.34,3.24,in the last three years it has good
1102.02,3.539,search volume the difficulty is a lot
1103.58,3.719,lower meaning this is a number from zero
1105.559,4.381,to 100 based on how difficult it is to
1107.299,4.38,rank for this that's easier the traffic
1109.94,3.42,potential is 27k which is actually
1111.679,3.661,really high but the volume is a bit
1113.36,4.02,lower than best vacuum cleaners but if
1115.34,4.32,we look at the examples here we can see
1117.38,3.659,there are signs that we can Rank and
1119.66,2.94,what we're looking for here is low
1121.039,3.481,Authority sites on the first page
1122.6,3.78,ranking on Google that's a sign that you
1124.52,4.56,can too so we see yes there is the
1126.38,4.74,spruce.com yes there is Forbes however
1129.08,3.54,when we look at domain rating which is a
1131.12,3.24,number from 0 to 100 based on the
1132.62,3.84,authority of the site we can see there
1134.36,4.5,are low sites here on the first page so
1136.46,5.839,there's bethr martin.com
1138.86,5.699,there is decorhint.com
1142.299,4.12,inspireddesigntalk.com as well so these
1144.559,4.62,are three sites with domain ratings
1146.419,5.341,under 40. one's a 22 not many backlinks
1149.179,4.38,to it pretty new site and it's ranking
1151.76,3.779,on page one getting a good amount of
1153.559,3.48,traffic for that keyword so that's a
1155.539,3.121,good sign a newer and emerging product
1157.039,3.901,is easier to rank for a little bit
1158.66,3.96,longer tail less competition and you see
1160.94,3.42,low low Authority sites on the first
1162.62,4.32,page the other example here was tiny
1164.36,5.819,house kitchen ideas so low volume
1166.94,5.479,low difficulty again we see a few low
1170.179,4.201,Authority sites here on the first page
1172.419,3.401,lilliancabinets.com is ranking for that
1174.38,3.539,so this is you know you just look for
1175.82,4.02,these opportunities we'll cover that and
1177.919,3.661,then dorm room ideas so something that
1179.84,3.3,is pretty good search volume eleven
1181.58,2.76,thousand anything over 10 I consider
1183.14,3.84,pretty high and like that's worth
1184.34,4.56,writing for an ideas type of article
1186.98,5.52,and we can see here
1188.9,6.18,like by Sophia Lee who has a
1192.5,5.52,teachers blogging uh she has dorm room
1195.08,5.04,ideas ranking here so makes sense and
1198.02,3.84,she's a 56 not that high so you'll find
1200.12,3.54,examples so every Niche is a little bit
1201.86,3.36,different if I just put in ideas so
1203.66,4.44,let's talk about informational posts
1205.22,4.319,first I can put in ideas and I can look
1208.1,3,at matching terms here and I can see
1209.539,3.661,well here's all the ideas in the world
1211.1,4.439,dinner ideas painting ideas Halloween
1213.2,4.44,ideas what if I made the max keyword
1215.539,3.961,difficulty 10 and I made it really low
1217.64,3.36,competition ideas post what would I find
1219.5,3.96,well I can see there's things like
1221,4.4,graduation cap ideas birthday a lot of
1223.46,4.44,birthday party things that aren't
1225.4,4.24,competitive at all I see that with like
1227.9,3,there's actually a lot of that so if you
1229.64,3.3,wanted to write about birthday party
1230.9,3.48,parties and celebration ideas you could
1232.94,2.88,probably get a ton of traffic to a site
1234.38,3,around that but you do that and then
1235.82,4.68,maybe you put in your Niche plus ideas
1237.38,5.039,so I would put in like Kitsch um
1240.5,3.059,living room ideas
1242.419,2.941,and then I could look at different
1243.559,3.24,things in there and I could see okay a
1245.36,2.819,lot of this is competitive like living
1246.799,3.421,room ideas is but not living room
1248.179,4.021,curtain ideas Farmhouse living room
1250.22,3.48,ideas apartment living room ideas these
1252.2,2.88,are all things we could rank for and
1253.7,4.32,what's interesting is informationally
1255.08,4.26,there's you know different types of seed
1258.02,2.88,keywords that you can use in the niche
1259.34,3.42,so if your home blog it's probably ideas
1260.9,3.659,living room kitchen ideas patio ideas
1262.76,2.94,but if you're in Fitness and you're
1264.559,3.421,running the fitness Niche you want to
1265.7,3.66,create a fitness affiliate website we're
1267.98,2.46,creating these posts to get a lot of
1269.36,2.22,traffic they're not going to make that
1270.44,3.119,affiliate Revenue but they're going to
1271.58,3.54,build the business as a whole so for
1273.559,2.761,that it would be like exercises if
1275.12,3.179,you're in Fitness
1276.32,3.96,you could find matching terms there you
1278.299,3.061,see okay a lot of exercises are somewhat
1280.28,3.06,competitive but what if we put the
1281.36,3.6,keyword difficulty down to Max 20 and
1283.34,2.94,then we look at the results for that and
1284.96,3.3,we can see that okay maybe I could rank
1286.28,3.66,for tricep dumbbell exercises that has
1288.26,3.299,good search volume trigger finger
1289.94,4.32,exercises that's interesting push
1291.559,5.161,exercises jawline exercises pull for so
1294.26,4.38,you find them by filtering that out or
1296.72,3.9,it could be workouts
1298.64,5.34,you put that keyword difficulty Max to
1300.62,4.62,20 show results and you can see what all
1303.98,2.88,these workouts I could write thigh
1305.24,2.939,workouts upper ab workouts a lot of
1306.86,3.179,things low competition you just got to
1308.179,3.36,look for it and find it uh one another
1310.039,3.12,interesting one in information is like
1311.539,3.241,how to so I can search for how to do
1313.159,3.481,stuff
1314.78,3.24,um for me like there's everything how to
1316.64,3.36,screenshot on a Mac is one of the most
1318.02,4.56,popular ones how to lose weight all of
1320,4.44,that what if I put in like how to start
1322.58,3.12,a business very competitive but you can
1324.44,2.64,start to find these ideas start a
1325.7,2.64,YouTube channels less how to start a
1327.08,3.78,conversation with a girl start your own
1328.34,4.079,business Drop Shipping so how to's are
1330.86,2.76,also interesting another one that you
1332.419,3.361,would look at if you're a food blog
1333.62,4.08,informationally would be recipes that's
1335.78,3.36,why they make so much ad Revenue with
1337.7,3.24,those is because they're writing all
1339.14,3.48,kinds of different recipes and I'll put
1340.94,3.96,like Max 30s see what comes up in
1342.62,4.439,different recipes endless amount so you
1344.9,3.84,could do like chuck roast recipes 60 000
1347.059,4.201,searches a month cube steak recipes
1348.74,5.1,shredded chicken recipes kielbasa flank
1351.26,4.26,steak if you had a recipe Food blog you
1353.84,3.24,know you for food you would probably
1355.52,4.38,like affiliate opportunities would be
1357.08,4.32,like Gadgets in the kitchen expensive
1359.9,4.139,items in the home things that can help
1361.4,4.68,you the products to cook but then mainly
1364.039,4.741,it's recipes that's the informational
1366.08,4.14,intent of that Niche so you could rank
1368.78,3.36,for a lot of recipes that way so that's
1370.22,3.48,a little bit about informational content
1372.14,3.659,now let's talk about transactional
1373.7,3.959,affiliate articles so the example I had
1375.799,3.24,here before was best modular sectionals
1377.659,3.661,but how do we find these opportunities
1379.039,5.041,for affiliate Revenue well we put in
1381.32,4.26,best plus our niche so I could try best
1384.08,3.3,kitchen and then I could look at
1385.58,3.36,different matching terms that include
1387.38,5.22,the term best kitchen with other things
1388.94,5.7,I could then filter this down I can see
1392.6,4.439,if I make the keyword Max keyword
1394.64,4.5,difficulty something like 25 and I just
1397.039,3.541,do the results there I'll be able to see
1399.14,2.76,different opportunities so things like
1400.58,3.24,kitchen towels
1401.9,3.72,see how Kitchen Nightmares episodes is
1403.82,3.479,in here and the difficulty is so low
1405.62,3.539,because things that are not very
1407.299,3.36,monetizable are going to be lower so
1409.159,2.581,things that can make more money are
1410.659,2.4,going to have more competition more
1411.74,2.88,people writing the Articles around it
1413.059,2.401,you have to find your sweet spot in the
1414.62,2.1,middle
1415.46,3,where you can still rank for these
1416.72,4.38,things that are newer things so
1418.46,5.16,there's kitchen rugs kitchen torch
1421.1,6.6,kitchen gifts kitchen shoes kitchen mats
1423.62,6.72,lots of things what about like uh faucet
1427.7,4.74,best kitchen faucet
1430.34,3.66,best touchless kitchen faucet is a great
1432.44,2.76,one right there pretty expensive
1434,3.72,probably it's the one that you touch
1435.2,3.719,1000 search volume low difficulty and
1437.72,2.819,you can do this in any Niche like
1438.919,3.181,fishing
1440.539,3.601,you search for best fishing and then you
1442.1,3.54,just look and see the difficulty in what
1444.14,3.12,you can rank for so you can see things
1445.64,3.96,like best braided fishing line best
1447.26,5.159,sunglasses for fishing fishing line best
1449.6,4.26,bass fishing line reels boats lures you
1452.419,3,find all these opportunities and it's
1453.86,3.179,just giving you what to write what
1455.419,4.561,articles to create for your blog golf
1457.039,5.401,clubs bags grips drivers
1459.98,5.52,irons you could just keep going on and
1462.44,5.64,on kayaking best kayaking best you know
1465.5,4.86,inflatable kayak fishing kayak amazing
1468.08,3.66,hot tub I mean any anything that you
1470.36,3.059,think about Amazon you can create you
1471.74,3.72,just have to stay in one Niche but you
1473.419,3.721,create this content best you know hot
1475.46,3.719,tub for money best hot tub covers Plug
1477.14,3.48,and Play Hot Tub the list is really
1479.179,2.701,endless but you find them with best and
1480.62,2.58,then we start stack ranking these
1481.88,3.12,keywords based on what will make us the
1483.2,3.66,most affiliate Revenue so that includes
1485,3.48,what is the search volume what is the
1486.86,3.179,competition how do you how well do you
1488.48,2.88,think you can Rank and then what is the
1490.039,2.88,affiliate what I call the affiliate
1491.36,2.819,Revenue potential this is something that
1492.919,2.701,takes a little bit of brain power that's
1494.179,2.941,not in one of these tools how much
1495.62,3.419,affiliate money can you make and
1497.12,3.419,typically that's how expensive is the
1499.039,2.88,product that you're promoting and then
1500.539,3.661,what is the commission rate of that
1501.919,4.201,company so if I'm talking about a five
1504.2,3.54,thousand dollar hot tub and I have a 10
1506.12,3.78,commission from that hot tub company
1507.74,3.9,well then that's 500 every single time
1509.9,3.3,someone is buying something from me so
1511.64,2.82,we don't want to be going after you know
1513.2,3.24,promoting
1514.46,4.5,things that are cheap a pair of socks
1516.44,4.56,paper clips best paper clips of 2023
1518.96,3.3,that doesn't sound all that exciting but
1521,3.12,if you have something that is worth more
1522.26,3,money you just have to live in the zone
1524.12,2.72,of understanding this stuff because
1525.26,4.08,everything that's been around forever
1526.84,4.42,and can make people money is very
1529.34,4.02,competitive but there's new products
1531.26,3.36,emerging all the time so that's the key
1533.36,3.179,in the heart and soul of your affiliate
1534.62,3.72,marketing business is finding keywords
1536.539,3.361,being on The Cutting Edge and finding
1538.34,3.78,this stuff so for example I did this
1539.9,3.779,with my own I did best software I put
1542.12,4.32,that in and then I looked at you know
1543.679,4.98,what was emerging what was new a lot of
1546.44,4.02,it was very competitive but I I got in
1548.659,4.321,early so timing is a crucial component
1550.46,4.94,of this too one I did was like best uh
1552.98,4.86,podcast hosting so I rank for that now
1555.4,5.2,somewhere and it's like the difficulty
1557.84,4.439,is now 56. uh it's pretty tough to rank
1560.6,5.04,for but if you look at it I'm on page
1562.279,5.52,one for that you know and I make 9 000
1565.64,3.96,plus dollars a month from that usually
1567.799,3,nine to thirteen thousand dollars a
1569.6,3.179,month because I've been recurring and
1570.799,5.101,making income so it's finding and
1572.779,4.681,spotting Trends sometimes even even the
1575.9,3,keywords aren't even in a traps or a
1577.46,3.48,tool like this you'd have to go to
1578.9,4.019,Google Trends to spot something and this
1580.94,3.359,is where your personal brand Niche
1582.919,2.821,selection knowing what you're talking
1584.299,3.36,about really helps because you might
1585.74,3.36,know a certain area and have expertise
1587.659,3.721,and find affiliate marketing
1589.1,4.26,opportunities before anyone else and
1591.38,3.419,that's the key too like knowing about
1593.36,3.66,what you're talking about can actually
1594.799,3.841,help you rank for stuff because you know
1597.02,3.24,about it and write about it way earlier
1598.64,3.659,than other people do so we can stack
1600.26,3.96,rank these keywords just add them into a
1602.299,4.141,spreadsheet put some information on them
1604.22,4.68,and just keep them in one place you have
1606.44,3.839,them you know ready to use so we have
1608.9,3.42,keywords but now what do we do well
1610.279,3.961,successful articles that make money
1612.32,5.16,they're assembled not written they're
1614.24,4.319,not written generally and creatively and
1617.48,2.939,now they're all different they're all
1618.559,4.681,pretty much the same and this is what I
1620.419,4.14,call the content assembly line method so
1623.24,3.179,here's the truth not every single
1624.559,4.98,article you write is going to rank maybe
1626.419,4.321,20 of them will rank so 80 of your time
1629.539,3.541,is going to be spent on articles that
1630.74,4.679,don't rank so how do we maximize our
1633.08,4.86,efficiency to create much content as we
1635.419,4.441,can high quality content not poor
1637.94,3.54,quality content but good content where
1639.86,4.02,we're actually moving on creating more
1641.48,3.9,articles and not being perfectionists I
1643.88,3.12,remember when I started my blog I spent
1645.38,3,two weeks on an article because I
1647,3.059,thought it was amazing it was about
1648.38,3.36,human nature and human potential and why
1650.059,2.761,we don't live up to our potential and it
1651.74,3.059,was a good article but I've since
1652.82,3.42,deleted it from my site because it
1654.799,3.48,didn't get any traffic no one gave a
1656.24,3.9, it wasn't optimized for keywords so
1658.279,3.661,the content assembly line method is
1660.14,3.96,thinking like Henry Ford your blog is
1661.94,3.78,like Henry Ford or like McDonald's you
1664.1,3.78,need to master the process of content
1665.72,3.54,creation yourself have a system and a
1667.88,2.88,process for it and you can do that
1669.26,3.12,before you Outsource it to another
1670.76,3.299,writer this is why an affiliate
1672.38,3.419,marketing business is great because it's
1674.059,3.901,the one type of business that doesn't
1675.799,3.841,require your direct input I created
1677.96,3.18,YouTube videos because I want to expand
1679.64,3.3,my business and personal brand outside
1681.14,3.659,of blogging but you don't have to do
1682.94,4.14,that you can if you want to go to like
1684.799,3.661,seven eight figures but if you want to
1687.08,2.94,stay in six figures you just create a
1688.46,4.14,blog but we need to
1690.02,4.38,create a replicable process for Content
1692.6,3.66,creation because we're busy we might
1694.4,3.899,have kids we have responsibilities we
1696.26,3.6,have a we all all of us most of us
1698.299,3,probably start a blog with a full-time
1699.86,3.9,job like I did
1701.299,4.5,so how do we do this well first is we
1703.76,4.08,create a minimum viable post an MVP
1705.799,3.24,something that's good enough move on so
1707.84,2.579,if I'm creating the best modular
1709.039,3.781,sectionals article I'm not going to
1710.419,3.661,create the 25 best and look up
1712.82,3.42,everything like write the perfect review
1714.08,4.86,I'll start with five or I'll start with
1716.24,4.679,seven and then I'll create a good enough
1718.94,4.08,article that's long enough based on the
1720.919,4.38,competition that's optimized for on-page
1723.02,4.08,SEO that can rank but I'm not going to
1725.299,4.38,be perfect I'm not going to make it 10
1727.1,6,000 words long we can also use Ai and
1729.679,5.341,SEO tools so things like Surfer SEO
1733.1,3.72,which is definitely recommended the
1735.02,3.42,first one I actually really recommend
1736.82,4.2,that you buy at an ongoing basis I'll
1738.44,5.16,cover that but things that tell you
1741.02,3.84,exactly how to do this on page SEO then
1743.6,3.54,we have the same format of these
1744.86,3.78,articles then we publish it we let
1747.14,3.36,Google index it and then we can always
1748.64,3.18,go back and update blog posts so blog
1750.5,3.059,post should be updated every like three
1751.82,3.479,to six months or so and that depends on
1753.559,3.901,the niche if it's really evergreen or
1755.299,3.841,not and we have we add eventually we add
1757.46,3.42,unique content to it things like those
1759.14,4.38,content blocks I showed you your own
1760.88,5.039,unique take maybe infographic a video
1763.52,4.139,something that you know can be added
1765.919,3.661,over the course of a year or two later
1767.659,3.721,on but we have to make it eventually
1769.58,3.959,unique rewrite the intro make it better
1771.38,4.08,for human beings so we start with a
1773.539,4.5,minimum viable post optimized for SEO
1775.46,5.04,and then over time we update this and
1778.039,3.601,that is the key to ranking this content
1780.5,3.96,so first we have to talk about the
1781.64,4.08,article structure in on-page SEO so
1784.46,2.579,there's a lot of different factors here
1785.72,2.76,there's the URL there's your headline
1787.039,3.781,there's intros there's blocks there's
1788.48,4.14,content so how do we lay it all out well
1790.82,3.239,first we talk about the URL the URL of
1792.62,3,your blog post is really the only thing
1794.059,4.561,that you can't change so we put that
1795.62,4.98,Target keyword into the URL and no other
1798.62,3.72,things so you don't add like the full
1800.6,3.24,title into that URL you don't add the
1802.34,3.42,year because the year will change and
1803.84,2.939,then you have to change your URL the URL
1805.76,3.36,is the only thing you can't change
1806.779,3.78,because what if like you change it but
1809.12,3.419,you have links pointing to it now those
1810.559,3.72,are 404 broken links or you get
1812.539,2.821,backlinks from other sites to you so
1814.279,2.941,that needs to stay the same everything
1815.36,4.14,else the title the content everything
1817.22,3.72,inside of it can change really there's
1819.5,3.419,different things for on-page SEO there's
1820.94,4.32,title there's your blog title headings
1822.919,3.781,content meta descriptions and then you
1825.26,3.18,can use different tools you can use like
1826.7,3.66,rank math to cover some of these bases
1828.44,3.599,you can use Moz to check your title tag
1830.36,3.419,to make sure it's not truncated and it's
1832.039,3.541,the right length and it looks good but
1833.779,2.88,you can do that you also want to
1835.58,3.479,probably have a table of contents
1836.659,4.62,because easy navigation people clicking
1839.059,4.98,around being able to access stuff easy
1841.279,4.38,to navigate blog posts are good for SEO
1844.039,3.601,because it keeps people engaged it keeps
1845.659,3.9,them longer dwell time maybe a lower
1847.64,3.36,bounce rate and things like that let me
1849.559,2.941,talk about affiliate content blocks so
1851,2.76,these should eventually be added to all
1852.5,3.179,your posts they don't need to be added
1853.76,3.18,right away and these bring eyeballs to
1855.679,2.521,your links you get more clicks on your
1856.94,3.54,affiliate links you can make more money
1858.2,4.38,and these can be created with cadence or
1860.48,3.419,tool X Specter as well but there's a
1862.58,3.06,basic structure that we'll cover so
1863.899,3.241,we'll run through a few examples here of
1865.64,4.56,exactly how posts should be laid out but
1867.14,5.279,there's an H1 heading intro H2S h3s and
1870.2,3.599,it's a templatized Content assembly line
1872.419,2.581,method so first I'm going to show my own
1873.799,4.441,site this is my article on the best
1875,4.919,webinar software of April 2023 I changed
1878.24,2.88,that every month and then what we have
1879.919,2.88,here is an introduction and this
1881.12,4.08,includes the target keyword webinar
1882.799,4.441,software or best webinar software right
1885.2,4.68,here as well that's in the Target the
1887.24,4.62,title so the title should be number plus
1889.88,4.14,plus your target keyword plus what I
1891.86,3.6,call search intent trigger words this is
1894.02,3.3,kind of like click bait but being more
1895.46,3.12,helpful so you want to add some stuff to
1897.32,2.88,get people to click because higher
1898.58,4.44,click-through rates on the Google search
1900.2,4.38,results can also help you odd numbers
1903.02,3.36,typically work better than even numbers
1904.58,4.56,as well for some reason
1906.38,4.74,now I have a five column across block
1909.14,3.36,section you can do this or not I didn't
1911.12,2.939,have this for the first like year year
1912.5,3.299,and a half of this article so it's not a
1914.059,4.321,big deal you could do a top three even
1915.799,4.74,these are affiliate links here going to
1918.38,4.26,the site but here we have we have an
1920.539,5.221,introduction very simple you want to
1922.64,5.58,give uh some information basically with
1925.76,4.139,an affiliate list post for on-page SEO
1928.22,3.24,like this the goal is to cover your
1929.899,3.841,bases so that when someone reads this
1931.46,3.42,they feel like they got all the bases
1933.74,3.179,covered and they understand everything
1934.88,4.08,but the big thing here is
1936.919,4.561,this is the format this is your first H2
1938.96,4.199,heading so H2 is the second most
1941.48,5.28,important type of heading next to your
1943.159,5.221,H1 so H2 includes what is the plus your
1946.76,2.94,target keyword what is the best webinar
1948.38,3,software and we write this because this
1949.7,3.24,is how Google likes to read stuff if
1951.38,3.179,everything was just paragraph text on
1952.94,3.599,the page Google wouldn't understand
1954.559,3.72,what's most important or how to organize
1956.539,3.301,stuff or pull it into a featured snippet
1958.279,4.681,or where to rank it or any of that stuff
1959.84,5.819,so this is uh the best format for it is
1962.96,5.64,H2 and then we have the answers to this
1965.659,4.74,question so the answers are h3s which is
1968.6,3.9,the title of the company this is an H3
1970.399,4.38,heading so this is number one which is
1972.5,3.84,livestorm I had a sentence here that it
1974.779,3.241,you know is kind of gives it what it's
1976.34,3.6,best for as a high level overview of
1978.02,3.18,someone skimming because people honestly
1979.94,3.18,skim these articles they don't read
1981.2,3,every single word especially when it
1983.12,2.52,comes to this they want to just click
1984.2,3,through on the affiliate links learn a
1985.64,3.419,little bit about it but I give my take
1987.2,4.26,you know this is also a new section that
1989.059,4.801,we created this is an affiliate link and
1991.46,4.02,then we have you know the content of the
1993.86,3.059,actual review so we have a little bit of
1995.48,4.439,paragraph content you'll see that the
1996.919,5.221,link was added here we have images and
1999.919,4.86,then we have features we have user
2002.14,4.44,experience we have pricing so we go over
2004.779,3.721,the pricing what it costs what I like
2006.58,4.68,and dislike product recent product
2008.5,4.019,updates a call to action sentence you
2011.26,2.94,know you can get started for free and
2012.519,3.78,upgrade to a Premium plan and then a
2014.2,4.02,button so these are all easy to create
2016.299,5.061,In Cadence blocks but once we're done
2018.22,3.14,with that we have this information
2021.7,3.12,um it's the exact same thing for number
2023.14,3,two three four five and six so this is
2024.82,2.76,these are actually longer and I started
2026.14,3.419,with probably half this length of
2027.58,4.02,content for each company but over time
2029.559,3.421,over the years we update it and add more
2031.6,3.959,content and make it a little bit better
2032.98,4.02,now here's the question do you have to
2035.559,4.021,use every single product in your
2037,3.84,affiliate list post the answer is no but
2039.58,2.579,this is again going back to where
2040.84,3.54,personal branding and Niche selection
2042.159,3.601,come in I was in the software world for
2044.38,3.66,a little while I used a lot of these
2045.76,4.139,tools I was a um I worked in the tech
2048.04,4.619,World in Austin so I had a lot of
2049.899,4.561,experience here and with software you
2052.659,3.661,can even free trial the software and
2054.46,2.879,like look at stuff and test it out a
2056.32,2.519,little bit
2057.339,3.241,ultimately we want to create the most
2058.839,2.881,helpful content possible so Google
2060.58,3.599,created what's called The Helpful
2061.72,4.26,content update in 2022 and really it's
2064.179,4.801,like anything that's not adding to the
2065.98,5.22,conversation or making things more you
2068.98,3.419,know valuable is not going to be ranked
2071.2,3.24,as well so you can't just like pull
2072.399,3.72,features from livestorm.com pull the
2074.44,2.82,exact same thing that used to work you
2076.119,3.72,could just pull features from the
2077.26,4.8,website some competitor sites put it in
2079.839,4.26,here rewrite it make it your own a
2082.06,4.14,little bit maybe test it a little bit
2084.099,4.74,but that's just not working as well
2086.2,4.199,anymore so you really have to you know
2088.839,3.121,this is where your Niche expertise comes
2090.399,3.181,in now I'm not saying if you're a
2091.96,3.659,photography blogger or you want to make
2093.58,3.98,money via affiliate marketing for like
2095.619,4.261,camcorders so you have to go buy
2097.56,4.18,Seventeen five thousand dollar cameras
2099.88,3.479,that's not realistic and when you look
2101.74,3.599,at the internet and see who's ranking
2103.359,3.601,for this stuff like Tom's guide CNET
2105.339,2.941,they're not they're they have thousands
2106.96,2.94,and thousands of products on their
2108.28,2.94,website they're literally not testing
2109.9,4.26,every single one it's the unfortunate
2111.22,5.76,truth of the internet which is you know
2114.16,4.98,reviews are based on ranking SEO if
2116.98,4.2,you're really SEO and strategy not
2119.14,4.08,necessarily always what's the best
2121.18,3.72,but it's a templatized way to do it
2123.22,3.42,let's look at another example best rock
2124.9,4.56,climbing shoes of 2023 this is
2126.64,4.08,Switchback travel which is a outdoor
2129.46,3.36,site they talk about all kinds of stuff
2130.72,3.78,but we see introduction some of their
2132.82,3.299,top picks at the top so that's easy to
2134.5,3.359,click through the affiliate links and
2136.119,4.141,then the best overall you know number
2137.859,4.021,one down the line number two and again
2140.26,2.4,it has the sentence about what it's best
2141.88,2.52,for
2142.66,2.88,I like this layout better than mine they
2144.4,2.52,probably have more money than me and
2145.54,4.2,they you know they spend a lot more
2146.92,5.1,content but you know you you make do
2149.74,3.42,with what you can and these are
2152.02,3.839,affiliate links so anytime someone
2153.16,5.34,clicks through and purchases this shoe
2155.859,4.381,219 shoe they get a commission from Back
2158.5,4.079,Country so
2160.24,4.44,similar layout
2162.579,3.421,uh there's another one here from Gizmodo
2164.68,4.62,the best vegan protein powders
2166,4.619,introduction top picks and then all of
2169.3,3.84,this information now you'll see
2170.619,4.441,sometimes like with very specific stuff
2173.14,4.08,like television supplements things that
2175.06,4.74,have a lot of facts they have a lot of
2177.22,5.639,different layouts here with
2179.8,5.1,um columns and rows and so you can get
2182.859,3.24,creative with it again when you're first
2184.9,2.82,starting you don't need any of this
2186.099,5.281,fancy stuff you can just literally have
2187.72,5.22,H2 what is the best H3 numbered list of
2191.38,2.94,the companies or products and then
2192.94,3.12,paragraph text just make sure you're
2194.32,3.36,covering what kind of features what kind
2196.06,3.36,of things should be covered in that
2197.68,4.32,product review here's another one the 25
2199.42,5.939,best luxury watches for men show up in
2202,5.76,style in 2023 I'm not super fancy so I
2205.359,3.601,don't really care about what I look like
2207.76,3.96,that much
2208.96,4.08,um so we see there's also ads in this
2211.72,3.54,post so affiliate marketing is great
2213.04,4.38,because you can also have ads on your
2215.26,3.9,affiliate articles if you want sometimes
2217.42,3.179,it makes sense sometimes it doesn't if
2219.16,3.24,it's a really profitable affiliate
2220.599,3.181,article probably and it doesn't get a
2222.4,2.699,ton of traffic but it makes a ton of
2223.78,2.76,affiliate Revenue probably doesn't make
2225.099,2.701,sense to have ads because if you're
2226.54,3.12,making a few grand and then you make 20
2227.8,3.9,more in ads it just distracts people but
2229.66,4.62,you can have both and this is again the
2231.7,5.52,top overall picks going to very much
2234.28,5.04,luxury watches the number one which
2237.22,4.5,price is only available upon request
2239.32,4.5,which means we know it's very very
2241.72,4.02,expensive probably and also just a quick
2243.82,3.9,note on these how-to or informational
2245.74,3.48,posts they're pretty much formatted and
2247.72,3.06,written the exact same way so like
2249.22,4.32,here's my post on how to start a blog
2250.78,4.319,and as you see the internet is lists
2253.54,3.6,people love lists people understand
2255.099,4.681,information in a list format so even the
2257.14,4.74,info content the recipes the exercises
2259.78,4.2,the how to do things those informational
2261.88,3.66,posts that can make you add revenue and
2263.98,2.82,link to your affiliate posts they're
2265.54,3.539,pretty much formatted the same way too
2266.8,3.9,introduction and then a number of
2269.079,3.841,different steps now when you're writing
2270.7,3.48,a how-to guide you can actually add
2272.92,2.159,affiliate links in a slightly different
2274.18,3.54,way
2275.079,4.201,so I would add them as part of the
2277.72,3.54,process of doing the thing that you're
2279.28,3.72,doing so any website that is making
2281.26,4.62,affiliate Revenue has these two types of
2283,4.26,posts informational and transactional so
2285.88,3.239,how to do stuff and then the products
2287.26,3.839,you need to do those things so when
2289.119,3.421,we're talking about how to you would add
2291.099,3.361,it like this a little bit more naturally
2292.54,3.66,in the content here's the steps to set
2294.46,3.84,up your blog this is exactly how you do
2296.2,4.379,it with Bluehost so sign up here click
2298.3,5.76,that link so you write it but also
2300.579,5.341,as we see here a how-to guide is also a
2304.06,3.96,numbered list of different steps in a
2305.92,3.72,process so again it's just what are the
2308.02,3.78,steps what's the most helpful how do we
2309.64,3.6,have table of contents in that so it's a
2311.8,2.88,similar process to write these kinds of
2313.24,3.54,Articles as well so let's talk about
2314.68,4.38,speeding up the content creation process
2316.78,3.96,with AI so there's a lot of new AI tools
2319.06,3.12,on the market that can help us we don't
2320.74,2.339,have to write as much anymore it's great
2322.18,2.28,so
2323.079,2.341,here's what I reckon here some of the
2324.46,3.36,tools I recommend I'm gonna go through
2325.42,4.14,them one by one so chat GPT obviously
2327.82,3.6,everyone knows that one this is not
2329.56,3.72,great for like writing full articles but
2331.42,3.3,it's best for ideation so coming up with
2333.28,3.42,ideas and that's things like keyword
2334.72,4.02,ideas you can do topical Authority
2336.7,3.899,mapping so give me article ideas based
2338.74,4.14,around this keyword that'll cover my
2340.599,3.901,topical map and make me look like an SEO
2342.88,3.54,expert they can come up with titles
2344.5,3.66,outlines and then really short articles
2346.42,4.26,simple ones that you can edit but it's
2348.16,4.14,great for ideation coming up with ideas
2350.68,3.899,another one is Jasper so this is
2352.3,3.96,in-depth content creation so this is you
2354.579,3.601,know built on top of AI tools to help
2356.26,4.44,you with your content creation this is
2358.18,4.679,best for manual AI content so yes it has
2360.7,3.48,a ways to write content itself but you
2362.859,2.881,have to do a little bit more work on
2364.18,3.12,your end to give it the right inputs
2365.74,3.66,make sure that it's formatted correctly
2367.3,3.539,give it the right recipe and work on it
2369.4,3.06,that way and then probably edit it a
2370.839,4.081,good amount so it's not uh you know
2372.46,4.56,looks like AI content another one is
2374.92,3.96,content at scale so this is the best for
2377.02,4.02,Rapid content creation so this is the
2378.88,3.719,best one where basically all you do is
2381.04,3.24,you put in here's my keyword this is how
2382.599,3.24,long I want the article to be a few
2384.28,3.72,check boxes here and there you hit enter
2385.839,4.02,and then it will in about five minutes
2388,3.06,or so finish the article for you and
2389.859,3.841,it's pretty much done and then you put
2391.06,4.14,it through an SEO tool like server SEO
2393.7,3.06,so this is the must have one the first
2395.2,4.62,real software costs that I recommend
2396.76,5.16,after web hosting so for a real
2399.82,3.48,affiliate marketing business if you have
2401.92,2.699,no money to start a business then you
2403.3,3.42,shouldn't start this affiliate marketing
2404.619,3.301,business because it doesn't take much
2406.72,2.639,we're not starting a brick and mortar
2407.92,3.54,business we don't have inventory and
2409.359,4.081,overhead and rent and employees like
2411.46,3.48,most traditional businesses do we can
2413.44,3.48,start a business online in this
2414.94,5.1,affiliate business that makes 90 profit
2416.92,5.1,margins for twenty dollars a month or
2420.04,3.84,whatever it is but we have to you know
2422.02,4.86,people ask me a lot how much does hrefs
2423.88,6,cost well it's 100 to 200 a month which
2426.88,4.02,isn't low you can get the 99 a month
2429.88,2.94,plan
2430.9,3.12,um you can share it with somebody we
2432.82,2.82,have people in our blog growth engine
2434.02,3.72,community that share accounts sometimes
2435.64,3.84,or they help each other out or you can
2437.74,4.2,sign up for a month and then cancel do
2439.48,4.32,all your keyword research and cancel uh
2441.94,3.36,Surfer is the first one at 49 a month
2443.8,4.26,that I recommend because it gives you
2445.3,4.38,exactly what to do for on-page SEO so
2448.06,3.539,for example I had an article here about
2449.68,3,GoDaddy Alternatives it gives you a
2451.599,2.281,Content score it gives you how many
2452.68,2.52,words you need in the article how many
2453.88,3,headings how many paragraphs how many
2455.2,3.24,images and then it gives you all the
2456.88,3.9,semantic keywords you need and this is
2458.44,3.659,really important so human beings we
2460.78,3.36,can't come up with every single
2462.099,4.141,variation of the word that Google's
2464.14,3.479,natural language processing and machine
2466.24,3.42,learning expects to see in this
2467.619,3.661,affiliate article but Surfer SEO will
2469.66,3.24,tell us that so it says you should put
2471.28,3.12,the word website builder in here eight
2472.9,3.48,to 13 times
2474.4,4.199,you should put in random stuff here free
2476.38,4.44,SSL certificate this many times so you
2478.599,4.141,or a writer or somebody should go
2480.82,3.96,through this and get this Surfer score
2482.74,4.02,up and then this gives it a better
2484.78,3.42,chance of ranking and the truth is a lot
2486.76,3.12,of people are using these tools so if
2488.2,2.82,you're not and you're just thinking that
2489.88,3.6,you're going to write the next thing
2491.02,4.2,well Google's scanning all the Articles
2493.48,4.2,and the ones that have all this stuff
2495.22,3.899,all these words in it makes it seem more
2497.68,3.36,robust a better article so they're going
2499.119,3.601,to outrank you so Surfer is one that
2501.04,3.9,gives you the semantic keywords and it's
2502.72,4.26,the best for on-page SEO so you can
2504.94,3.78,definitely check that out
2506.98,3.359,um so that's the one I fully recommend
2508.72,3.78,it's really the one of the first ones
2510.339,3.121,you definitely need content scale is a
2512.5,2.099,really good one too if you have the
2513.46,2.76,money too and you don't want to write
2514.599,2.76,everything yourself click the link in
2516.22,2.58,the description below for that one if
2517.359,3.301,you're interested now once you have
2518.8,4.14,content we have a keyword plan
2520.66,4.56,we have our content assembly method
2522.94,4.8,mapped out we have a few articles on our
2525.22,4.2,blog and maybe your ranking it's time to
2527.74,3.119,join affiliate programs so I don't
2529.42,3.12,recommend you join affiliate programs
2530.859,3.061,before you have any traffic to your site
2532.54,2.4,with zero traffic it's just kind of a
2533.92,2.64,waste of time you're not going to make
2534.94,3.659,money anyways you might as well wait
2536.56,3.66,till you're getting some traffic in but
2538.599,2.881,there's some popular affiliate networks
2540.22,4.02,you can join like share a sale Amazon
2541.48,4.8,Associates this list here partner stack
2544.24,3.359,if you're promoting software impact's
2546.28,3.059,one of my favorite ones they have a ton
2547.599,3.541,of companies in there but you can sign
2549.339,3.421,up for a network where there's a bunch
2551.14,3.54,of individual affiliate programs and
2552.76,3.9,companies inside and you can join those
2554.68,3.6,inside of the network there's also
2556.66,3.6,individual affiliate programs so you can
2558.28,4.44,also find them by like Googling the
2560.26,3.78,product plus reviewer best find brands
2562.72,3.6,that it's linking to you could also just
2564.04,4.2,Google like uh you know if you're in our
2566.32,3.779,outdoor Niche you could Google like REI
2568.24,4.379,affiliate program Dick's Sporting Goods
2570.099,3.781,affiliate program all of that the lowest
2572.619,3.541,competition niches out there are
2573.88,4.62,physical products so things like Amazon
2576.16,3.78,Associates you can join at first but
2578.5,3.359,they have low commission rates low
2579.94,3.96,cookie duration so you'd eventually want
2581.859,4.081,to replace those Amazon links with
2583.9,3,actual company affiliate links so let's
2585.94,3.48,say you're writing about the best
2586.9,4.62,basketball hoops of 2023 you could just
2589.42,3.24,send all of it to Amazon at first and
2591.52,2.7,then you eventually once you start
2592.66,3.179,getting a little bit of traffic you
2594.22,3.599,could join like the Dick's Sporting
2595.839,3.301,Goods affiliate program then In Cadence
2597.819,2.941,blocks you could add both links check
2599.14,3.78,price on Amazon check price on
2600.76,4.319,dickssportinggoods.com or anything else
2602.92,3.48,but the key is we want to diversify and
2605.079,2.581,join a lot of different programs and
2606.4,3.12,they're pretty easy to find again you
2607.66,3.3,can Google the company plus affiliate
2609.52,3.059,program they even sometimes have it in
2610.96,2.76,the footer of their website and it's
2612.579,3.181,just a simple
2613.72,4.74,sign up form basically so you sign up
2615.76,4.26,you put in your website people say do
2618.46,3,you need a website if you're not willing
2620.02,2.52,to make a website then you shouldn't
2621.46,3.359,start an affiliate marketing business
2622.54,3.9,period so there's a learning curve on
2624.819,2.641,this a little bit but we have to do
2626.44,2.399,things that are a little bit difficult
2627.46,3.48,if we want to actually make real money
2628.839,3.721,we can't just say do I need a website to
2630.94,3,do this can I just grab the link and put
2632.56,3.539,it like okay maybe if you have a large
2633.94,3.84,social following you can do that our
2636.099,3.841,YouTube channel YouTube is also good for
2637.78,3.78,affiliate marketing but typically for
2639.94,3.24,these networks if you're signing up you
2641.56,3.6,put in your website your email address
2643.18,4.38,which should be a domain name email
2645.16,4.02,address like uh mine's like adaminfo.com
2647.56,3.48,instead of a Gmail it just looks more
2649.18,4.02,professional that's pretty much all you
2651.04,3.96,need you also need a PayPal account to
2653.2,3.18,get paid so if you're outside and you
2655,2.88,can't get a PayPal account it's kind of
2656.38,3.18,tough you might be able to find ways so
2657.88,3.66,they can pay your bank directly but
2659.56,3.84,PayPal is one of the most common ways to
2661.54,4.38,do it like partner stack uses stripe as
2663.4,3.54,well so every Network every company is a
2665.92,2.58,little bit different
2666.94,2.879,now let's talk about adding affiliate
2668.5,2.579,links to your site so there's different
2669.819,2.881,types of affiliate links there's like
2671.079,4.081,Banner ad affiliate links so you can
2672.7,3.84,grab or text affiliate links so text
2675.16,3.36,affiliate links are the ones that you
2676.54,4.14,saw on my site that are just in the text
2678.52,3.599,highlighted or in buttons those are the
2680.68,2.76,ones that make all the money if the
2682.119,2.641,search intent is there and somebody's
2683.44,4.379,searching for something they want to buy
2684.76,4.079,best webinar software they land on that
2687.819,2.401,article they see the number one
2688.839,2.941,recommendation they're just clicking
2690.22,3.66,those text links through so those are
2691.78,3.48,the ones that actually convert now
2693.88,3.12,adding your affiliate links into
2695.26,4.26,WordPress includes how I showed you
2697,3.9,earlier adding pasting it into getting
2699.52,3.48,that link from the affiliate platform
2700.9,4.919,once you're approved copying and pasting
2703,4.5,that into thirsty Affiliates giving it a
2705.819,3.421,title that's pretty much it and then
2707.5,3.78,anytime you add it in you go to your
2709.24,3.24,post you click instead of inserting a
2711.28,3.18,link there's going to be a little button
2712.48,3.119,that pops up next to it says ta thirsty
2714.46,3.119,Affiliates you search for it in there
2715.599,3.781,and that adds the text Link in very
2717.579,3.361,simple and then if the link changes ever
2719.38,3.12,or there's a new promotion or something
2720.94,3.659,you can just change the link once in
2722.5,3.06,thirsty Affiliates and all of them will
2724.599,2.581,update
2725.56,3.299,so I covered you know how do you
2727.18,3.54,optimize an article with affiliate links
2728.859,3.781,well in transactional posts let's look
2730.72,3.42,at my posts on online course platforms
2732.64,3.06,real quick so as you see this is another
2734.14,3.12,one it's formatted just like webinar
2735.7,3.119,software there's the introduction I have
2737.26,3.78,a video but then when we think about
2738.819,3.361,where do we add affiliate links well we
2741.04,3.24,don't want to overdo it but we don't
2742.18,3.72,want to underdo it so what I do is I add
2744.28,3.6,it to the first mention this is an
2745.9,3.48,affiliate link I add it here these two
2747.88,3.12,are affiliate links I added in the very
2749.38,3.239,first paragraph mention of the brand
2751,2.819,that's a good one and then pretty much
2752.619,2.821,you just you don't have to mention it
2753.819,3.241,much anymore you just go all the way
2755.44,3.54,down to where the button is and then
2757.06,4.74,what I would do is I would add one more
2758.98,5.94,in a call to action sentence I could
2761.8,4.68,have added it you know here or get
2764.92,2.939,started today I could have added it
2766.48,3.119,there but I just have it here and here
2767.859,4.681,as a button so you want to edit like
2769.599,5.041,three to five times in each company's
2772.54,3.539,little section and be done with it we
2774.64,2.64,don't want to overdo it they're pretty
2776.079,2.461,much going to click the button something
2777.28,3,close to the button or something near
2778.54,3.299,the top and then back to uh
2780.28,3.059,informational post how to start a blog I
2781.839,3.181,already showed you that that's like in
2783.339,3.361,the steps of the process this is what
2785.02,3.9,you have to do go here do this thing
2786.7,3.36,sign up for this so there's another
2788.92,3.179,question how do you order these
2790.06,3.24,companies in your post well if you're
2792.099,2.461,starting a new affiliate article you
2793.3,3.42,want to look at the competition what's
2794.56,3.72,already ranking out there
2796.72,4.02,um because if somebody's been ranking
2798.28,4.92,for a highly competitive or profitable
2800.74,4.68,keyword or even just a new and emerging
2803.2,3.3,keyword they probably have some data and
2805.42,1.919,they're ordering things in the right
2806.5,2.22,order
2807.339,3.661,so you look at the price you look at the
2808.72,5.28,commission rates and the hidden one is
2811,4.98,the conversion rates so as a blogger as
2814,3.359,an affiliate marketing business owner we
2815.98,2.76,have control over
2817.359,2.76,you know our ranking how many clicks
2818.74,3.18,we're getting in our affiliate links but
2820.119,4.081,once we send the affiliate link click to
2821.92,4.02,the company it is 100 on them to convert
2824.2,3.659,that user that visitor into a customer
2825.94,3.72,and sometimes there's brands that have
2827.859,3.541,horrible conversion rates even though
2829.66,3.72,you think they're going to be good so
2831.4,4.26,for example if you are recommending golf
2833.38,5.52,drivers you don't want to put like a
2835.66,5.459,five thousand dollar set number one you
2838.9,5.1,typically want to put the medium like
2841.119,4.561,best well-known popular mid-tier company
2844,3.48,number one because that's the one most
2845.68,3.78,people are gonna buy so even though it's
2847.48,3.48,like oh the price and the commission
2849.46,4.32,rate look great it's five thousand
2850.96,4.619,dollars eight percent commission I'd
2853.78,3.839,make way more than if it was a thousand
2855.579,4.081,dollars but the hidden factor is that
2857.619,4.441,conversion rate of the actual brand so
2859.66,4.86,like sometimes it could be zero I've
2862.06,4.259,seen where like the price or the
2864.52,3.059,commission rate I was receiving was
2866.319,2.461,three times higher so I'm like oh I'm
2867.579,2.401,gonna make more money but then I made
2868.78,2.819,nothing because the brand couldn't
2869.98,3.42,convert so you have to think about how
2871.599,4.201,well known and popular the brand is and
2873.4,4.56,that's the ordering and luckily you know
2875.8,4.559,if you know your Niche well it's easier
2877.96,4.56,and typically the most popular and best
2880.359,4.321,companies the ones that actually have
2882.52,3.66,the best affiliate programs are usually
2884.68,2.76,the best companies anyway so it actually
2886.18,2.88,works out for everybody all right
2887.44,3.54,finally let's talk about running a real
2889.06,3.24,affiliate marketing business and some
2890.98,2.94,strategies here first we have to say
2892.3,3.84,don't put all your eggs in one basket
2893.92,4.32,don't Join one affiliate program rely on
2896.14,4.86,one article this is a you need a machine
2898.24,4.56,behind this a Content assembly line a
2901,3,way to add and join affiliate programs
2902.8,2.7,and something that's you know
2904,3.18,consistently being
2905.5,3.9,gasoline is being poured in and it's
2907.18,4.02,keep being done so is it completely 100
2909.4,3,passive no there's no such thing as
2911.2,2.76,passive income you have to put the
2912.4,3.179,working up front you have to water the
2913.96,2.94,plants if you want to keep them alive
2915.579,3.121,but you could have somebody else
2916.9,3.959,watering the plants eventually which is
2918.7,4.44,the nice part I barely spend any time on
2920.859,4.201,my blog now but it makes typically 150
2923.14,4.199,000 a month so we don't want to put it
2925.06,3.9,all in one basket we need to diversify
2927.339,3.181,our business so that means joining a lot
2928.96,2.879,of affiliate programs not just having
2930.52,3.24,one article rank but eventually having
2931.839,3.78,five to ten articles ranking making
2933.76,3.3,consistent Revenue there's a lot of
2935.619,2.941,disciplines when it comes to running an
2937.06,3.12,affiliate marketing business there's
2938.56,3.059,writing the content there's joining the
2940.18,2.7,programs and networks there's adding
2941.619,3.421,affiliate links and tracking the
2942.88,4.02,performance actually getting paid so
2945.04,3.18,usually it's just as easy as PayPal and
2946.9,2.64,they do it automatically but sometimes
2948.22,2.16,Brands can be a pain in the ass and
2949.54,2.88,they're like
2950.38,3.9,send me an invoice for the exact amount
2952.42,3.72,or fill out this tax form or do this or
2954.28,3.78,that so we really need an affiliate
2956.14,4.08,marketing machine behind all of this so
2958.06,3.66,similar to the content assembly line we
2960.22,3.42,need a process to do all this to join
2961.72,4.08,programs to add links to track data to
2963.64,3.36,get paid this is an ongoing process that
2965.8,2.519,never stops when you're first starting
2967,2.579,your blog and you're getting momentum
2968.319,2.581,and you're ranking for stuff you're
2969.579,2.941,probably joining a lot of programs
2970.9,3.24,adding a lot of links in and doing all
2972.52,3.599,of that then you kind of get to a steady
2974.14,4.14,state like now I don't join a ton of new
2976.119,4.98,programs you know we do write new and
2978.28,4.559,emerging transactional articles but
2981.099,3.061,we're not like it's not in that phase
2982.839,4.381,anymore it's kind of the steady state
2984.16,4.439,phase but here's what I would do to
2987.22,2.76,start adding affiliate links in and
2988.599,4.141,getting this machine and business
2989.98,4.44,running so you create your website you
2992.74,3.98,do your keyword research like I taught
2994.42,5.52,you create a Content process to create
2996.72,5.2,monetizable articles and then
2999.94,3.419,maybe you update the Articles and then
3001.92,3.36,what you do is you track landing page
3003.359,3.541,sessions in Google analytics so you want
3005.28,3.299,to see all right is this is this actual
3006.9,2.939,article getting any traffic once it's
3008.579,3.361,getting a little bit of traffic then
3009.839,3.721,it's time to look at joining and adding
3011.94,4.139,these affiliate links in
3013.56,3.96,so you can join the programs you add in
3016.079,4.02,your links so usually you just start
3017.52,4.62,with the base length directly to the
3020.099,3.72,product no affiliate link just link to
3022.14,3.24,it then you swap that out with an
3023.819,3,affiliate link then you want to track
3025.38,3.479,your data so look at the affiliate
3026.819,3.54,dashboards whether it's a network or a
3028.859,3.181,program and then you want to make
3030.359,4.26,adjustments based on one to three months
3032.04,4.2,of data so is that company making money
3034.619,3.301,in the number one spot is the number two
3036.24,3.119,company making more than that should
3037.92,3.179,they be put higher do you want to talk
3039.359,3.901,to the affiliate manager can you get a
3041.099,4.561,higher commission rate can you negotiate
3043.26,4.859,make sure you get paid and rinse and
3045.66,3.959,repeat so really it's a process of
3048.119,2.821,getting the Articles to rank once
3049.619,3.24,they're on page one
3050.94,3.6,then the money starts flowing in the
3052.859,3,hard part is not adding affiliate links
3054.54,3.059,the hard part is not joining affiliate
3055.859,3.181,programs the hard part is actually
3057.599,3.361,building a real affiliate marketing
3059.04,3.299,business so affiliate marketing really
3060.96,2.76,relies on consistency and
3062.339,2.941,diversification a lot of people that
3063.72,4.139,teach it on YouTube are like use
3065.28,4.559,ClickBank and it shows you in 15 minutes
3067.859,3.661,here's how to make 100 bucks because
3069.839,4.5,people click on those things the
3071.52,5.339,algorithm rewards lazy content about
3074.339,4.561,making money fast and overnight and
3076.859,4.861,unfortunately that never works in
3078.9,4.86,business or in life so we have to
3081.72,4.139,realize that building this personal
3083.76,3.96,brand building something for ourselves
3085.859,4.021,you can live a dream life and you can
3087.72,4.92,make a lot of money but just extend that
3089.88,4.739,time Horizon out from three months or 90
3092.64,4.26,days or you know I want to make money
3094.619,4.021,this week to I can make money a little
3096.9,3.06,bit of money in three to six months but
3098.64,2.58,I also know that I want to build
3099.96,3.119,something in the background of my life
3101.22,3.839,that doesn't consume my life that I
3103.079,3.361,enjoy doing that can make me money for
3105.059,2.701,years to come
3106.44,3.24,so the thing is you can set up an
3107.76,4.02,affiliate site in a day but it's the
3109.68,3.36,real business strategy that actually
3111.78,2.579,makes you money so if you're interested
3113.04,3.12,in learning the real business strategy
