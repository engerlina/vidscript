0.08,4.199,these are the seven mistakes that will
1.88,4.16,fck your small account on X they'll drop
4.279,4.041,your engagement to zero and they'll stop
6.04,4.16,you from ever gr past more than a few
8.32,4.56,hundred followers the first mistake is
10.2,4.72,sending automated cold direct messages
12.88,4.159,with no personalization this could get
14.92,4.76,your account shadowbanned and stop all
17.039,4.08,of your momentum before it even starts
19.68,3.12,and the best way to stop doing this
21.119,3.32,mistake is to at the very least
22.8,3.52,personalize your message follow the
24.439,3.84,Creator that you're direct messaging and
26.32,3.959,maybe even interact on the timeline
28.279,3.761,before you send that message the worst
30.279,3.361,thing that you can do is to tell someone
32.04,3.48,that you love their content and you're
33.64,3.64,not even following them it can do a hell
35.52,3.4,of a lot of damage to your reputation
37.28,3.84,and stop you from ever being able to
38.92,4.36,contact that Creator again as they may
41.12,4.48,have muted you or even blocked you the
43.28,4.48,second mistake is posting explicit or
45.6,4.4,hateful content controversy is one of
47.76,4,the most popular ways to grow on X many
50,4.32,creators will use controversial
51.76,4.56,statements or post crazy videos to get
54.32,3.759,engagement and get people commenting
56.32,3.48,because it gets more people to engage
58.079,3.96,and more people to potentially follow
59.8,4.56,you but if you go too controversial X
62.039,4.361,can label you as a hateful account and
64.36,4.119,potentially shadowban you or the worst
66.4,4.079,case scenario is X can ban you off the
68.479,3.721,platform altogether there is a fine line
70.479,3.361,to Trad and if you want to stop yourself
72.2,3.559,from doing this have a look at what
73.84,4.24,other controversial content creators are
75.759,4.121,doing and always tread that fine line
78.08,3.679,the third mistake is posting when you
79.88,3.84,feel like it you need to have a
81.759,4.161,consistent posting schedule if you want
83.72,4.039,to grower following on X when X sees
85.92,3.6,that you're posting content consistently
87.759,3.761,they will promote your account to more
89.52,4.2,people also your audience will get used
91.52,4.08,to you and trust you more as they know
93.72,3.8,you are going to show up on the timeline
95.6,3.68,every single day a great way to overcome
97.52,3.36,this is to schedule your content in
99.28,3.799,batches and make sure that you're
100.88,4.559,showing up every day you can use a tool
103.079,4.281,like hyp Fury to make this super easy
105.439,4.36,for you the fourth mistake is to only
107.36,4.439,ever engage with small accounts Elon
109.799,4.561,recently released the algorithm source
111.799,4.32,code and in it it says that if you are a
114.36,3.719,person who only engages with small
116.119,4.36,accounts your account will be flagged as
118.079,4.4,somebody of low value to get around this
120.479,4.761,you need to engage with a mixture of
122.479,5.041,small medium and large size accounts for
125.24,4.12,one if you engage with a massive account
127.52,4.359,they will potentially see your content
129.36,3.8,and they could repost it or also engage
131.879,3.241,with you as well that gives you
133.16,3.799,visibility on the timeline which in turn
135.12,3.44,gets people to come to your account and
136.959,3.681,potentially follow you the best way to
138.56,4.12,engage with big accounts is to drop some
140.64,4,value packed replies if you do that
142.68,3.68,regularly more people will come a look
144.64,3.48,at what you're actually creating for
146.36,4.08,yourself and if you've got a great
148.12,3.96,account and a good profile picture then
150.44,3.6,they're going to engage with your stuff
152.08,4.56,as well the fifth biggest mistake is
154.04,5.36,using hashtags in your content hashtags
156.64,4.76,look super spammy and just aesthetically
159.4,4.72,look terrible so the short answer here
161.4,5,is do not use hashtags in your content
164.12,4.119,no matter what anybody else tells you
166.4,4.199,the sixth biggest mistake we see is
168.239,4.961,using chunks of text in your content
170.599,5.401,walls of text are impossible to read you
173.2,4.959,want to create nice neat paragraphs so
176,4.12,that people can read your content easily
178.159,3.961,think of your writing as an aesthetic
180.12,4.08,piece of art and make it so that it's
182.12,4.28,nice for people to consume because if
184.2,4.44,they like it they're more likely to like
186.4,4.16,it and repost it into their feed the
188.64,4.2,simple rule here is if you make your
190.56,4.2,content easy to read then people will
192.84,4.52,enjoy reading it and the seventh and
194.76,5.28,final mistake is only ever sharing value
197.36,4.879,in your content advice is nice but every
200.04,4.72,single Creator at the moment is doing it
202.239,4.601,so share your personal stories a picture
204.76,4.679,that only you can share and you'll add
206.84,4.52,some personality to your personal brand
209.439,4.201,that way you can build a cult around
211.36,4.68,yourself and not just your niche as
213.64,3.959,someone who is a guy who gives advice by
216.04,3.479,the way if you want to grow your ex
