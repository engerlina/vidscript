0.04,5.04,"I studied over 16,000 x profiles and"
3.28,3.92,discovered something crazy smaller
5.08,4.96,creators are doing things better than
7.2,4.559,bigger creators and maybe even you too
10.04,3.599,in fact what we found out meant that the
11.759,3.401,video you're about to watch is way
13.639,4.521,different than the one we ended up
15.16,5.24,making and we found out three unexpected
18.16,4.199,lessons that we think are just way more
20.4,3.6,important but to help you understand
22.359,3.801,we're going to go back to the start of
24,4.88,this story so a few weeks ago I made a
26.16,4.279,"video on how to go from 0 to 10,000"
28.88,3.719,followers in as quick as time as
30.439,3.96,possible but to ex veterans those
32.599,3.601,tactics may seem relatively
34.399,3.721,straightforward write a couple of tweets
36.2,3.839,a day one or two threads per week and
38.12,4.24,make sure that your profile is looking
40.039,4.121,great now that's great advice sure but
42.36,3.679,we got a comment that said what if I'm
44.16,3.879,following all of this advice and I'm
46.039,3.921,still not getting any further so I took
48.039,4.561,this question back in house to Hype Fury
49.96,5.439,HQ where we have access to the analytics
52.6,5,of thousands of active X users I was
55.399,4,pretty excited to dive into the data to
57.6,4,see what I could find out and after
59.399,4.441,hours of searching and sorting I managed
61.6,4.04,to find three creators who were doing
63.84,4.16,things way differently than everybody
65.64,4.479,else what I found out is that engagement
68,3.92,isn't everything sure a huge account
70.119,4.161,gets thousands of likes and reposts on
71.92,4.64,their content but after a certain size
74.28,4.04,that engagement is simply expected but
76.56,3.8,just because the metrics on a post look
78.32,4.159,good doesn't really add up to anything
80.36,4.24,because how can you learn something new
82.479,4.081,from somebody if they get likes and
84.6,3.199,reposts on every single thing that they
86.56,2.84,make and that is the moment that I
87.799,4.241,realized that I was making the wrong
89.4,4.64,"video and ex users with under 10,000"
92.04,4.039,followers can actually teach us way more
94.04,3.84,than you'd expect the first lesson is
96.079,3.561,probably the simplest one ever what's
97.88,4.08,amazing about it is that you make your
99.64,4.04,ex experience 10 times more fun and you
101.96,3.32,can make some friends in the process of
103.68,3.88,doing it you'll sharpen your speaking
105.28,4.56,skills and communicate with real people
107.56,4.68,in real time and if you're really Brave
109.84,4.559,you can brush shoulders with some CEOs
112.24,4.08,and some aess celebrities see if you can
114.399,4.72,guess what it is from this super short
116.32,5.2,clip let's let's talk about orbit for a
119.119,4.721,second and Earth orbit um that's right
121.52,4.959,it's the criminally underused feature of
123.84,4.88,spaces on X now you don't need to have a
126.479,4.041,pro account on X to set up a room you
128.72,3.68,don't even need to have started the room
130.52,3.96,for you to join in the fun and grab the
132.4,4.32,mic fast growing marketing guy Nicholas
134.48,4.039,Verge has shut up in followers recently
136.72,4.2,by hosting some spaces with some
138.519,4.8,creators with some huge followings all
140.92,3.88,he's done is asked them to be his guest
143.319,3.081,what this means is that the larger
144.8,3.4,Creator's audience will come into the
146.4,3.68,room and see what's going on and if they
148.2,3.64,like what Nicholas is saying then maybe
150.08,3.96,they'll just follow him too which means
151.84,3.96,this is an incredible way to get growing
154.04,3.64,and to start a community of your own
155.8,4.159,Nicholas then mentions his community and
157.68,3.6,he already has some warm people who know
159.959,2.64,exactly what they're going to get from
161.28,2.64,him they've already developed a
162.599,2.841,relationship with him because they've
163.92,3.399,heard him talk and they know what he's
165.44,4.56,like as a person here's how you can get
167.319,5.161,started in spaces yourself start by
170,4.319,joining other spaces first listen and
172.48,3.479,see what's going on in the room you can
174.319,3.681,react to the posts that are announced in
175.959,3.881,the space to show your support then when
178,3.959,you join the space you can ask for for
179.84,4.16,the mic or listen or react to what's
181.959,4.441,going on when you finally do create a
184,4.72,space of your own decide on a topic and
186.4,4.399,then just launch it and get moving and
188.72,3.4,be a good host by making sure that
190.799,3.761,everybody in the room gets an
192.12,4.24,opportunity to speak so spaces are a
194.56,3.959,great thing that we can learn from a
196.36,3.879,smaller account that is fast growing so
198.519,3.64,the next person is flying with the
200.239,3.761,growth of his account and he's building
202.159,4.481,things in the right way but what he's
204,5.12,doing is so simple it almost feels like
206.64,4.319,cheating this is Jake Youngblood let me
209.12,3.96,explain the powerful thing that he's
210.959,4.041,doing that makes his content 10 times
213.08,4.359,more interesting many people are telling
215,4.76,you to add value and give actionable
217.439,4.52,pieces of advice and that is fantastic
219.76,4.119,advice what Jake is doing is taking
221.959,4.041,things a lot further than that good
223.879,4.481,content creators must inject their own
226,3.64,personality and their own authenticity
228.36,3.4,if they're going to connect with their
229.64,4.159,audience in a world where everybody's
231.76,4.6,copying everybody else Jake brings his
233.799,4.8,own unique brand of irrational optimism
236.36,3.64,and authenticity to the timeline but
238.599,3.761,what are the ways that you can bring
240,4.319,authenticity to your own content so that
242.36,3.879,you can harness this powerful tool as
244.319,3.401,well let's look at the niche that you're
246.239,3.481,currently in if you're in the
247.72,3.799,productivity and coaching Niche write
249.72,3.879,down all the major players in your
251.519,4.121,industry then write a list of your own
253.599,3.92,unique attributes and the traits that
255.64,4.2,make you different essentially what
257.519,4.761,makes you you then when you're making
259.84,5,content ask yourself how can I make this
262.28,4.88,more engaging more fun and bring a sense
264.84,4.52,of creativity to the content that I make
267.16,4.16,remember that social media is sometimes
269.36,4.2,an escape from the world so if you can
271.32,4,bring a sense of likeness and optimism
273.56,4.04,to the timeline then you're going to get
275.32,4.48,a load of people that also resonate with
277.6,4.72,that energy so well done Jake keep
279.8,4.8,creating and growing your community of
282.32,4.159,irrational optimists the next lesson was
284.6,3.319,a really powerful wakeup call for me
286.479,3.401,because when I stumbled across this
287.919,4,account I realized that he does things
289.88,4.599,that the majority of people tell you not
291.919,4.441,to do his bio is really basic and His
294.479,3.921,Banner is a picture of his dog and he
296.36,4,doesn't even show his face but it made
298.4,3.92,me reconsider because what this guy has
300.36,4.399,done he's grown his account to nearly
302.32,4.439,"10,000 followers by doing almost nothing"
304.759,4.401,that everybody else does let me tell you
306.759,3.921,first a learning that many creators fall
309.16,3.68,into the Trap of picture this you've
310.68,4.239,been making X content for a while your
312.84,3.88,banner is perfect your profile seems
314.919,4.321,like you're writing the right content
316.72,4.72,but you see a guy who's not doing any of
319.24,4,those things and he's grown way faster
321.44,4.64,than you enter the solution to this
323.24,4.92,problem by our Rising Star leis Pereira
326.08,4.64,he is an entrepreneur currently building
328.16,5.319,an AI tool called audio pen he is
330.72,5.12,focusing purely on his digital product
333.479,4.16,all of the buzz is happening organically
335.84,3.76,because of the value that he's bringing
337.639,4.201,doesn't even have anything to do with
339.6,4,his ex profile he's being invited on
341.84,3.84,podcasts and the users of his product
343.6,4.4,are actively shouting him out on big
345.68,4.56,accounts but you don't have to be an AI
348,4.28,genius like lisis to have this tactic
350.24,4.239,used for yourself digital products can
352.28,4.32,simply be a recording of you teaching
354.479,4.081,somebody something specific that solves
356.6,4.319,a problem this can be recorded on a
358.56,4.68,presentation split up into modules and
360.919,4.641,then thrown up on something like kajabi
363.24,4.239,or gumroad Word of Mouth travels fast so
365.56,3.96,if you can focus on your product instead
367.479,4.081,of any growth tactics then that can be
369.52,4.32,an amazing way to grow your account
371.56,4.919,seeing Lewis's recent growth has shown
373.84,4.44,me that social media isn't your business
376.479,3.56,your business is your business so make
378.28,3.359,sure you focus on the product that
380.039,3.401,you're selling so if you focus on
381.639,3.761,getting an amazing product out there
383.44,4,first then social media growth can
385.4,3.76,happen as a result of the value that you
387.44,3.319,bring for a different reason so there
389.16,3.879,you have here three not so small
390.759,4.601,creators giving you three pretty useful
393.039,5,lessons that you can use in your own ex
395.36,4.959,growth Journey growing as a Creator on X
398.039,4.761,is a NeverEnding game of acquiring and
400.319,4.44,applying skills now these may be three
402.8,4,influential tactics that you can use for
404.759,3.56,yourself but they're pretty useless if
406.8,3.48,you do not know the skill of
408.319,3.481,copyrighting and that is why this is the
410.28,3.24,video that you want to watch next
411.8,4.959,because in there I'm going to show you
413.52,3.239,exactly how to do it
