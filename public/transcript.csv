2.04,5.44,platform in 2024 gaining millions of
5,5,users every single month it is the best
7.48,5.079,time for anyone to grow a mega viral
10,4.679,brand and become the next big thing but
12.559,4.161,how on Earth does someone go from zero
14.679,3.641,to hundreds of thousands of followers if
16.72,3.719,they know nothing about growing a
18.32,4.24,Brandon X in this video I'll share with
20.439,4.481,you the full blueprint of how to start
22.56,4.719,and scale a Brandon X and do it in the
24.92,5.08,fastest time possible without spending a
27.279,4.921,single penny on ads step one is to start
30,4.399,start with your desired outcome in mind
32.2,4.72,this reason is so important because it
34.399,4.641,underpins absolutely everything you do
36.92,3.56,next so you have to nail it you cannot
39.04,2.92,know whether you're moving in the right
40.48,3.28,direction if you don't know the
41.96,4.2,destination that you're heading towards
43.76,4.279,ask yourself the basic questions of what
46.16,3.76,you want from the platform do you want
48.039,4.121,customers a bigger Network do you want
49.92,4.279,to be seen as the influential voice in
52.16,4,your field this has to be nailed down
54.199,3.561,because everything flows from here and
56.16,3.879,once you've got that Crystal Clear
57.76,4.88,outcome in your mind it's on to the next
60.039,4.4,step step two is a Clean and Smart
62.64,3.88,Professional Profile the first thing
64.439,4.961,people notice on X is your profile
66.52,5,picture having a smart trusty profile
69.4,4.44,picture and not being anonymous is the
71.52,4.599,way to go here take a professional head
73.84,4.4,shot and use a high quality image
76.119,4.201,because you only get one chance to make
78.24,4.519,a first impression so you better make it
80.32,4.24,count next is getting a clean and
82.759,3.841,professional Banner that matches your
84.56,4.32,brand identity yes there are people who
86.6,4.24,just throw up a picture of a beach view
88.88,3.72,but we are going for fast growth here
90.84,4.279,many of the bigger creators put their
92.6,4.199,offer and a clear call to action as to
95.119,3.601,what to do next you can get one
96.799,4.121,professionally made or there are some
98.72,4.439,awesome templates on canva with the
100.92,4.04,exact dimensions all you need to do is
103.159,4.121,just change out the wording you want to
104.96,4,have a bio that tells people exactly
107.28,4,what it is you do and what you're going
108.96,4.28,to do for them you want a bio that tells
111.28,4.68,everybody what you do who it's
113.24,4.4,specifically for and some credibility in
115.96,3.92,there as to who you've helped in the
117.64,4.799,past you can also put a call to action
119.88,4.159,to direct people as to what to do next
122.439,4.081,this could be to go to a link in your
124.039,4.601,bio or to click on your newsletter or
126.52,4.439,just direct them to your PIN post you
128.64,4.48,put yourself ahead of so many people if
130.959,4.121,you already have real results so make
133.12,3.96,sure to show them off if you haven't got
135.08,4.04,any real results yet then put down what
137.08,3.68,you're building or what your mission is
139.12,3.399,so that people can follow along on the
140.76,3.92,journey with you whatever you put keep
142.519,4.041,it concise and skimmable because you
144.68,4.12,only get a certain amount of tension
146.56,4.039,before people are onto the next profile
148.8,3.96,your PIN post is a another highly
150.599,3.72,underutilized area that people just miss
152.76,3.96,out on you can put in there a
154.319,4.56,transformation your own personal story
156.72,3.84,or it's a great opportunity to just put
158.879,3.401,some great value in there with a
160.56,3.679,clickable resource that someone can go
162.28,4.36,and download straight away take for
164.239,5.241,example brand advisor Atlas who is at
166.64,4.8,Dante Leo and he has everything aligned
169.48,3.92,with his brand as to what he's trying to
171.44,4.519,accomplish he has a clean photo which
173.4,4.479,showcases his authority and a value
175.959,4.161,packed thread that is pinned to the top

180.12,4.92,it is he can help you with this all
182,5.2,showcases his ability to help you build

190.239,3.481,hung up on what a niche or an industry
192.239,3.241,or who they're focusing on but just

195.48,4.52,you would best serve the best way to
197.56,3.88,find your Niche is to picture the ideal
200,3.64,customer that you would want to do
201.44,4.68,business with it is a great idea to go
203.64,4.319,into extreme detail at this point some
206.12,3.759,people even print off this Avatar and
207.959,3.601,put it above their workstation so that
209.879,3.401,they can pinpoint exactly who they're
211.56,3.679,talking to whenever they write their
213.28,4.2,content what is their age what is their
215.239,4.041,job what do they love and hate and what
217.48,3.52,is keeping them up at night these are

252.48,4.599,success find three to five people at the
255.04,3.8,top of their game in your industry and
257.079,3.801,then just copy exactly what they're
258.84,4.359,doing and analyze the things that you
260.88,4.759,can do to emulate that go on to X and
263.199,4.161,search for your favorite creators or

286.16,4.16,social media platform and the only way
288.199,4.201,to go viral is to connect with other
290.32,4.28,creators so you want to pick a rough
292.4,4.2,plan that you can stick to and stay
294.6,5.12,consistent with it an example for X
296.6,5.64,would be 25 to 30 comments a day four
299.72,5.28,personalized direct messages five posts
302.24,5.08,a day spread out between 2 to 3 hours to
305,4.479,give those posts time to get engagement
307.32,4.36,and you could even look at a theme or
309.479,4.44,style of those posts so that people can
311.68,3.68,see that it's your brand identity the
313.919,3.361,way you do this is if you pick
315.36,4,particular memes you would keep the same
317.28,4.039,font you would keep the same colors and
319.36,4.04,just be consistent with everything you
321.319,4.32,do the thing about engagement is you
323.4,4.4,just have to consistently do it there is
325.639,4.361,no way around this you have to put the
327.8,4.16,work in every single day if you want to

357.72,4.88,follow button a pro tip here is to reply
360.199,4.641,with a post that could be reposted on
362.6,4.24,its own on the timeline it goes without
364.84,3.88,saying that you have to reply on
366.84,4.16,comments underneath your own post
368.72,4.879,because this builds a stronger Community
371,5.28,direct messages and spaces are the way
373.599,4.401,to go for a really deep relationship
376.28,3.8,they are the best way to network and
378,4.039,take relationships off platform to
380.08,4.76,places like telegram step five is
382.039,5.16,creating content that attracts fans 2 to
384.84,5.04,five quality post is the average at the
387.199,5.481,moment but quality matters over quantity
389.88,5.08,in the age of AI being authentic matters
392.68,4.56,more than ever so write like you talk
394.96,4.84,and make sure that you sound like a real
397.24,4.959,person give stories that only you could
399.8,4.32,share from your own personal experience
402.199,3.72,and you'll differentiate yourself from
404.12,4.12,all of the artificial intelligence
405.919,4.241,people posting just generic content if
408.24,3.48,you share stories from your own life or
410.16,3.439,lessons that you've learned you will
411.72,3.68,develop a great relationship with your
413.599,4.241,followers adding your own personal
415.4,4.88,experiences adds value because it's only
417.84,4.759,a story that you can share this next tip
420.28,5.319,is a little bit tricky but controversy
422.599,5.32,and strong opinions drive virality on X
425.599,4.561,so be bold with your opinions and you'll
427.919,4.641,go far but make sure you're doing it
430.16,4.24,authentically otherwise people will tell
432.56,4.6,that it's a little bit fake and just for
434.4,5.079,engagement keep your writing concise and
437.16,4.319,clear you want to remain very simple
439.479,4.4,with the language that you use and to
441.479,4.481,avoid jargon look at what some of the
443.879,4.361,bigger creators are doing with regards
445.96,4.32,to spacing out your posts and making
448.24,3.959,sure that you stay away from over
450.28,3.88,complicated language remember you're
452.199,4.761,writing for the platform that you're on
454.16,4.68,and X is a very skimmable platform so if
456.96,3.679,you make things too hard to read then
458.84,4.199,people will just click off your account
460.639,4.321,being consistent is of huge importance
463.039,3.921,if you want to scale your brand so
464.96,4.6,scheduling content for a few days in
466.96,4.959,advance is what the biggest creators do
469.56,4.759,this makes sure you have maximum time to
471.919,4.68,focus on your business and you aren't
474.319,4.641,stuck to your phone all day step six is
476.599,4.121,value and Lead magnets because people
478.96,3.72,won't follow you if they don't get
480.72,4,something in return post some threads
482.68,4.239,which could be step-by-step guides some
484.72,4.36,Transformations or a value packed
486.919,4.56,resource that people can download this
489.08,4.839,gets followers for one and establishes
491.479,4.16,you as an authority to the people that
493.919,3.72,you're trying to serve you'll know when
495.639,3.96,you're providing value because people
497.639,3.641,will start to ask questions about the
499.599,3.761,content that you're creating and if
501.28,4.039,someone's asking a question it's a good
503.36,4,likelihood that that's a lead that you
505.319,3.72,can follow up with a direct message a
507.36,4.279,great way to supercharge your lead
509.039,5,magnet is to use the autod DM function
511.639,4.561,in Hy Fury you can write out a post
514.039,3.88,which says how you want people to engage
516.2,3.92,with it and then you can send that
517.919,4.281,resource completely automatically this
520.12,4.719,gets you likes and follows and gives
522.2,4.96,your lead magnet to that person all done
524.839,4.801,automatically and it's a great way to
527.16,4.52,build your following fast this method is
529.64,3.84,best used once you've established your
531.68,3.52,Authority because you don't want to
533.48,4.52,build an account by just giving away
535.2,4.759,freebies step seven is to analyze and
538,4.399,scale your account you you can use
539.959,4.88,analytics to find your best performing
542.399,4.601,content X analytics will show you your
544.839,4.12,best performing ideas from that month it
547,4.2,would make sense to look at them and
548.959,4.801,find out why they worked and maybe do
551.2,4.319,the same again but in Greater detail
553.76,3.8,your audience have told you what they
555.519,4.201,like so give them more of it you can
557.56,4.08,double down on the winning formulas and
559.72,4.32,give your audience more of what they
561.64,4.72,want take for example if you created a
564.04,4.6,list that got really good engagement you
566.36,4.4,could take that idea and break it down
568.64,3.92,into a thread on some of your highest
570.76,4.199,performing posts you can use the
572.56,4.839,Evergreen function in Hy Fury this is a
574.959,4.88,list of your greatest hits and is a
577.399,4.841,great way to repurpose content to people
579.839,4.881,who haven't seen it many people never
582.24,4.8,repurpose which is a waste of work
584.72,4.28,considering that 20% of your followings
587.04,3.799,see your posts the rest of them have
589,3.76,never seen it and think of all the new
590.839,3.841,people that follow you who can see some
592.76,3.8,of your greatst work remember how I
594.68,3.76,mentioned the importance of scheduling
596.56,4.279,content ahead of time so that you don't
