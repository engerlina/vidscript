X is the fastest growing social media
platform in 2024 gaining millions of
users every single month it is the best
time for anyone to grow a mega viral
brand and become the next big thing but
how on Earth does someone go from zero
to hundreds of thousands of followers if
they know nothing about growing a
Brandon X in this video I'll share with
you the full blueprint of how to start
and scale a Brandon X and do it in the
fastest time possible without spending a
single penny on ads step one is to start
start with your desired outcome in mind
this reason is so important because it
underpins absolutely everything you do
next so you have to nail it you cannot
know whether you're moving in the right
direction if you don't know the
destination that you're heading towards
ask yourself the basic questions of what
you want from the platform do you want
customers a bigger Network do you want
to be seen as the influential voice in
your field this has to be nailed down
because everything flows from here and
once you've got that Crystal Clear
outcome in your mind it's on to the next
step step two is a Clean and Smart
Professional Profile the first thing
people notice on X is your profile
picture having a smart trusty profile
picture and not being anonymous is the
way to go here take a professional head
shot and use a high quality image
because you only get one chance to make
a first impression so you better make it
count next is getting a clean and
professional Banner that matches your
brand identity yes there are people who
just throw up a picture of a beach view
but we are going for fast growth here
many of the bigger creators put their
offer and a clear call to action as to
what to do next you can get one
professionally made or there are some
awesome templates on canva with the
exact dimensions all you need to do is
just change out the wording you want to
have a bio that tells people exactly
what it is you do and what you're going
to do for them you want a bio that tells
everybody what you do who it's
specifically for and some credibility in
there as to who you've helped in the
past you can also put a call to action
to direct people as to what to do next
this could be to go to a link in your
bio or to click on your newsletter or
just direct them to your PIN post you
put yourself ahead of so many people if
you already have real results so make
sure to show them off if you haven't got
any real results yet then put down what
you're building or what your mission is
so that people can follow along on the
journey with you whatever you put keep
it concise and skimmable because you
only get a certain amount of tension
before people are onto the next profile
your PIN post is a another highly
underutilized area that people just miss
out on you can put in there a
transformation your own personal story
or it's a great opportunity to just put
some great value in there with a
clickable resource that someone can go
and download straight away take for
example brand advisor Atlas who is at
Dante Leo and he has everything aligned
with his brand as to what he's trying to
accomplish he has a clean photo which
showcases his authority and a value
packed thread that is pinned to the top
of his profile which says exactly what
it is he can help you with this all
showcases his ability to help you build
your personal brand step three is to
identify a niche or Avatar people get
hung up on what a niche or an industry
or who they're focusing on but just
think of it as a group of people that
you would best serve the best way to
find your Niche is to picture the ideal
customer that you would want to do
business with it is a great idea to go
into extreme detail at this point some
people even print off this Avatar and
put it above their workstation so that
they can pinpoint exactly who they're
talking to whenever they write their
content what is their age what is their
job what do they love and hate and what
is keeping them up at night these are
the things that you want to answer if
you want to really talk to an ideal
customer if you're really struggling
with the best person to help the person
who you have authority over helping is
yourself write out a list of the
accomplishments that you've achieved in
the last three years and then reverse
engineer them you can do a step-by-step
guide to show people exactly how you
solve that problem there is no doubt
that you'll be passionate about solving
that problem because you solved it
yourself the most successful Brands
understand their audience the best and
so make sure you do your homework and
serve your group of people to become a
success find three to five people at the
top of their game in your industry and
then just copy exactly what they're
doing and analyze the things that you
can do to emulate that go on to X and
search for your favorite creators or
keywords in the industry that you want
to be in look at those creators best
cont content and their tone of voice and
the types of people that they're
focusing on and don't forget people can
also change their niche as they go along
so don't get hung up on this and make
sure it doesn't stop you from getting
started step four is engaging with other
creators to maximize your growth X is a
social media platform and the only way
to go viral is to connect with other
creators so you want to pick a rough
plan that you can stick to and stay
consistent with it an example for X
would be 25 to 30 comments a day four
personalized direct messages five posts
a day spread out between 2 to 3 hours to
give those posts time to get engagement
and you could even look at a theme or
style of those posts so that people can
see that it's your brand identity the
way you do this is if you pick
particular memes you would keep the same
font you would keep the same colors and
just be consistent with everything you
do the thing about engagement is you
just have to consistently do it there is
no way around this you have to put the
work in every single day if you want to
grow create a list of people that you
want to build a relationship with
marketing Guru Russell Brunson calls
this your dream 100 that is the 100 best
customers or creators or clients that
you would want in your own Professional
Network put them into a Twitter list put
your notifications on and reply
immediately as soon as they write out a
post if you can get there with a high
quality post there is a good chance that
you will get your post noticed people
will come to your account and hit that
follow button a pro tip here is to reply
with a post that could be reposted on
its own on the timeline it goes without
saying that you have to reply on
comments underneath your own post
because this builds a stronger Community
direct messages and spaces are the way
to go for a really deep relationship
they are the best way to network and
take relationships off platform to
places like telegram step five is
creating content that attracts fans 2 to
five quality post is the average at the
moment but quality matters over quantity
in the age of AI being authentic matters
more than ever so write like you talk
and make sure that you sound like a real
person give stories that only you could
share from your own personal experience
and you'll differentiate yourself from
all of the artificial intelligence
people posting just generic content if
you share stories from your own life or
lessons that you've learned you will
develop a great relationship with your
followers adding your own personal
experiences adds value because it's only
a story that you can share this next tip
is a little bit tricky but controversy
and strong opinions drive virality on X
so be bold with your opinions and you'll
go far but make sure you're doing it
authentically otherwise people will tell
that it's a little bit fake and just for
engagement keep your writing concise and
clear you want to remain very simple
with the language that you use and to
avoid jargon look at what some of the
bigger creators are doing with regards
to spacing out your posts and making
sure that you stay away from over
complicated language remember you're
writing for the platform that you're on
and X is a very skimmable platform so if
you make things too hard to read then
people will just click off your account
being consistent is of huge importance
if you want to scale your brand so
scheduling content for a few days in
advance is what the biggest creators do
this makes sure you have maximum time to
focus on your business and you aren't
stuck to your phone all day step six is
value and Lead magnets because people
won't follow you if they don't get
something in return post some threads
which could be step-by-step guides some
Transformations or a value packed
resource that people can download this
gets followers for one and establishes
you as an authority to the people that
you're trying to serve you'll know when
you're providing value because people
will start to ask questions about the
content that you're creating and if
someone's asking a question it's a good
likelihood that that's a lead that you
can follow up with a direct message a
great way to supercharge your lead
magnet is to use the autod DM function
in Hy Fury you can write out a post
which says how you want people to engage
with it and then you can send that
resource completely automatically this
gets you likes and follows and gives
your lead magnet to that person all done
automatically and it's a great way to
build your following fast this method is
best used once you've established your
Authority because you don't want to
build an account by just giving away
freebies step seven is to analyze and
scale your account you you can use
analytics to find your best performing
content X analytics will show you your
best performing ideas from that month it
would make sense to look at them and
find out why they worked and maybe do
the same again but in Greater detail
your audience have told you what they
like so give them more of it you can
double down on the winning formulas and
give your audience more of what they
want take for example if you created a
list that got really good engagement you
could take that idea and break it down
into a thread on some of your highest
performing posts you can use the
Evergreen function in Hy Fury this is a
list of your greatest hits and is a
great way to repurpose content to people
who haven't seen it many people never
repurpose which is a waste of work
considering that 20% of your followings
see your posts the rest of them have
never seen it and think of all the new
people that follow you who can see some
of your greatst work remember how I
mentioned the importance of scheduling
content ahead of time so that you don't
need to think about cre creating 24/7
well I use hype Fury to do just that if
you want to head on into the description

trial to try it out for yourself and if
you want to grow from 0 to 10,000
