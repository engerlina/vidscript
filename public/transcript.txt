I studied over 16,000 x profiles and
discovered something crazy smaller
creators are doing things better than
bigger creators and maybe even you too
in fact what we found out meant that the
video you're about to watch is way
different than the one we ended up
making and we found out three unexpected
lessons that we think are just way more
important but to help you understand
we're going to go back to the start of
this story so a few weeks ago I made a
video on how to go from 0 to 10,000
followers in as quick as time as
possible but to ex veterans those
tactics may seem relatively
straightforward write a couple of tweets
a day one or two threads per week and
make sure that your profile is looking
great now that's great advice sure but
we got a comment that said what if I'm
following all of this advice and I'm
still not getting any further so I took
this question back in house to Hype Fury
HQ where we have access to the analytics
of thousands of active X users I was
pretty excited to dive into the data to
see what I could find out and after
hours of searching and sorting I managed
to find three creators who were doing
things way differently than everybody
else what I found out is that engagement
isn't everything sure a huge account
gets thousands of likes and reposts on
their content but after a certain size
that engagement is simply expected but
just because the metrics on a post look
good doesn't really add up to anything
because how can you learn something new
from somebody if they get likes and
reposts on every single thing that they
make and that is the moment that I
realized that I was making the wrong
video and ex users with under 10,000
followers can actually teach us way more
than you'd expect the first lesson is
probably the simplest one ever what's
amazing about it is that you make your
ex experience 10 times more fun and you
can make some friends in the process of
doing it you'll sharpen your speaking
skills and communicate with real people
in real time and if you're really Brave
you can brush shoulders with some CEOs
and some aess celebrities see if you can
guess what it is from this super short
clip let's let's talk about orbit for a
second and Earth orbit um that's right
it's the criminally underused feature of
spaces on X now you don't need to have a
pro account on X to set up a room you
don't even need to have started the room
for you to join in the fun and grab the
mic fast growing marketing guy Nicholas
Verge has shut up in followers recently
by hosting some spaces with some
creators with some huge followings all
he's done is asked them to be his guest
what this means is that the larger
Creator's audience will come into the
room and see what's going on and if they
like what Nicholas is saying then maybe
they'll just follow him too which means
this is an incredible way to get growing
and to start a community of your own
Nicholas then mentions his community and
he already has some warm people who know
exactly what they're going to get from
him they've already developed a
relationship with him because they've
heard him talk and they know what he's
like as a person here's how you can get
started in spaces yourself start by
joining other spaces first listen and
see what's going on in the room you can
react to the posts that are announced in
the space to show your support then when
you join the space you can ask for for
the mic or listen or react to what's
going on when you finally do create a
space of your own decide on a topic and
then just launch it and get moving and
be a good host by making sure that
everybody in the room gets an
opportunity to speak so spaces are a
great thing that we can learn from a
smaller account that is fast growing so
the next person is flying with the
growth of his account and he's building
things in the right way but what he's
doing is so simple it almost feels like
cheating this is Jake Youngblood let me
explain the powerful thing that he's
doing that makes his content 10 times
more interesting many people are telling
you to add value and give actionable
pieces of advice and that is fantastic
advice what Jake is doing is taking
things a lot further than that good
content creators must inject their own
personality and their own authenticity
if they're going to connect with their
audience in a world where everybody's
copying everybody else Jake brings his
own unique brand of irrational optimism
and authenticity to the timeline but
what are the ways that you can bring
authenticity to your own content so that
you can harness this powerful tool as
well let's look at the niche that you're
currently in if you're in the
productivity and coaching Niche write
down all the major players in your
industry then write a list of your own
unique attributes and the traits that
make you different essentially what
makes you you then when you're making
content ask yourself how can I make this
more engaging more fun and bring a sense
of creativity to the content that I make
remember that social media is sometimes
an escape from the world so if you can
bring a sense of likeness and optimism
to the timeline then you're going to get
a load of people that also resonate with
that energy so well done Jake keep
creating and growing your community of
irrational optimists the next lesson was
a really powerful wakeup call for me
because when I stumbled across this
account I realized that he does things
that the majority of people tell you not
to do his bio is really basic and His
Banner is a picture of his dog and he
doesn't even show his face but it made
me reconsider because what this guy has
done he's grown his account to nearly
10,000 followers by doing almost nothing
that everybody else does let me tell you
first a learning that many creators fall
into the Trap of picture this you've
been making X content for a while your
banner is perfect your profile seems
like you're writing the right content
but you see a guy who's not doing any of
those things and he's grown way faster
than you enter the solution to this
problem by our Rising Star leis Pereira
he is an entrepreneur currently building
an AI tool called audio pen he is
focusing purely on his digital product
all of the buzz is happening organically
because of the value that he's bringing
doesn't even have anything to do with
his ex profile he's being invited on
podcasts and the users of his product
are actively shouting him out on big
accounts but you don't have to be an AI
genius like lisis to have this tactic
used for yourself digital products can
simply be a recording of you teaching
somebody something specific that solves
a problem this can be recorded on a
presentation split up into modules and
then thrown up on something like kajabi
or gumroad Word of Mouth travels fast so
if you can focus on your product instead
of any growth tactics then that can be
an amazing way to grow your account
seeing Lewis's recent growth has shown
me that social media isn't your business
your business is your business so make
sure you focus on the product that
you're selling so if you focus on
getting an amazing product out there
first then social media growth can
happen as a result of the value that you
bring for a different reason so there
you have here three not so small
creators giving you three pretty useful
lessons that you can use in your own ex
growth Journey growing as a Creator on X
is a NeverEnding game of acquiring and
applying skills now these may be three
influential tactics that you can use for
yourself but they're pretty useless if
you do not know the skill of
copyrighting and that is why this is the
video that you want to watch next
because in there I'm going to show you
exactly how to do it
